{"text": "Activation of <extra_id_0> TLR4 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> induces the phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa-B ( IkappaB ) , which dissociates IkappaB with NF-kappa-B ( NFkappaB ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Then , NFkappaB translocates into the nucleus and activates and regulates the transcription of genes related to inflammatory responses .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "To detectd the activation of <extra_id_0> TLR4 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> - mediated NFkappaB signaling , the phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa-B ( p-IkappaB ) and activity of NFkappaB were measured by methods of Western Blots and EMSA .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Results showed that the p-IkappaB increased at 6 hours after ICH ( P < .05 ) , peaked on 3 days after ICH , and maintained a high level on 7 days after ICH ( P < .05 , Figure 5 ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
