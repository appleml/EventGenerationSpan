{"text": "To determine the HAI titers in infected mice , sera of these were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme ( RDE / Cholera filtrate ; Sigma ) to remove sialic acids from serum proteins capable of aspecific inhibition of agglutination .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "After incubation overnight at 37degreesC , the RDE was inactivated by addition of 0.75 % sodium citrate in PBS and heating to 56degreesC for 30 min .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "To remove sialic acid binding proteins , sera were cleared with 1 / 10 volume 50 % chicken RBC .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Titration was done by incubating a two-fold dilution series of sera with 4 HA units of X-47 virus for 1 hour at room temperature in 96-well U-bottom plates .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Finally , an equal volume of 0.5 % chicken RBC was added and titers were read 30 min later .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Negative controls included PBS instead of immune serum ( agglutination control ) or PR8 instead of X-47 virus ( control for agglutination effect of sera ) ; as positive control , serum from a mouse infected twice with a sublethal dose of X-47 was used .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
