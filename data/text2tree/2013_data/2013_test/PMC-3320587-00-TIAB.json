{"text": "Tuberculosis ( TB ) disease in HIV co-infected patients contributes to increased mortality by activating innate and adaptive immune signaling cascades that stimulate HIV-1 replication , leading to an increase in viral load .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Here , we demonstrate that silencing of the expression of the transcription factor <extra_id_0> nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> ( <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> ) by RNA interference ( RNAi ) inhibits Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTb ) - stimulated HIV-1 replication in co-infected macrophages .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We show that <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> gene and protein expression are strongly induced by MTb , which is a Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) ligand , and that an intact NFAT5 binding site in the viral promoter of R5-tropic HIV-1 subtype B and subtype C molecular clones is required for efficent induction of HIV-1 replication by MTb .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Furthermore , silencing by RNAi of key components of the TLR pathway in human monocytes , including the downstream signaling molecules <extra_id_0> MyD88 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , <extra_id_0> IRAK1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , and <extra_id_0> TRAF6 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , significantly inhibits MTb - induced <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> gene expression .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Thus , the innate immune response to MTb infection induces <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> gene and protein expression , and <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> plays a crucial role in MTb regulation of HIV-1 replication via a direct interaction with the viral promoter .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "These findings also demonstrate a general role for <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> in TLR - and MTb - mediated control of gene expression .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
