{"text": "Fluoro-Jade B ( FJB ) staining was used to identify degenerating neurons in tissues obtained from non-SE and 3 days post-SE animals in every group .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In our previous [ 18 , 25 ] and preliminary data , neuronal damage was first detectable at 3 days after SE .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Therefore , we determined 3 days after SE as the best time point to look FJB .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Briefly , sections were rinsed in distilled water , and mounted onto gelatin-coated slides and then dried on a slide warmer .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The slides were immersed in 100 % ethanol for 3 min , followed by 70 % ethanol for 2 min and distilled water for 2 min .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The slides were then transferred to 0.06 % potassium permanganate for 15 min and gently agitated .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "After rinsing in distilled water for 2 min , the slides were incubated for 30 min in 0.001 % FJB ( Histo-Chem Inc . , Jefferson , AR ) , freshly prepared by adding 20 ml of a 0.01 % stock FJB solution to 180 ml of 0.1 % acetic acid , with gentle shaking in the dark .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "After rinsing for 1 min in each of three changes of distilled water , the slides were dried , dehydrated in xylene and coverslipped with DPX ( Sigma-Aldrich Co . , St . Louis , MO ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "For stereological study , every sixth section in the series throughout the entire PC was used ( see below ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
