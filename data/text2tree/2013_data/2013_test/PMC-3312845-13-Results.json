{"text": "In our previous [ 5 , 7 , 8 , 20 ] and preliminary data , vasogenic edema and neuronal damage were noticeable at 1 day and 3 days after SE , respectively .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Therefore , we determined that 3 days after SE was the best time point to evaluate the effect of s <extra_id_0> TNFp55R <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> infusion on both vasogenic edema and neuronal damages induced by SE .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In saline-treated animals , the PC was stained diffusely with anti-rat IgG ( Figure 2A ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The volume of vasogenic edema was 17.1 +/- 1.5 mm3 ( Figure 2E ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The number of FJB - positive neurons in the PC was 236 , 145 +/- 49 , 469 ( Figure 2B ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In s <extra_id_0> TNFp55R <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> - treated animals , SE - induced vasogenic edema was attenuated to 9.8 +/- 0.7 mm3 ( Figures 2C and 2E ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In addition , the number of FJB - positive neurons in the PC was 89 , 138 +/- 5 , 698 ( Figures 2D-E ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Thus , s <extra_id_0> TNFp55R <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> infusion attenuated SE - induced vasogenic edema and neuronal damage compared to saline-infused animals ( p < 0.05 ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
