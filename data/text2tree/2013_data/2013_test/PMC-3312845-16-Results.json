{"text": "Recent studies have reported that neutrophils infiltrate the brain under certain pathological conditions [ 26 ] .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Indeed , we have reported massive neutrophil infiltration in layer III / IV of the PC 1 day after SE [ 20 ] .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In the present study , 1 day-post-SE animals of the saline-infused group showed infiltration of MPO - positive neutrophils into the PC .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Similarly , 1 day-post-SE animals of the s <extra_id_0> TNFp55R <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> - infused group showed neutrophil infiltration into the PC 1 day after SE ( Figure 6A ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The number of neutrophils / area in the PC region ( including the vasogenic edema region and the non-vasogenic edema region ) of s <extra_id_0> TNFp55R <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> - infused animals was significantly lower than that of the saline-infused group ( Figure 6D , p < 0.05 ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "However , there was no difference in neutrophil infiltration per unit area of vasogenic edema between the saline - and s <extra_id_0> TNFp55R <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> - infused groups ( Figure 6D ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Furthermore , neutrophil infiltration showed a direct proportion to the area of vasogenic edema , with a linear coefficient of correlation of 0.8631 ( p < 0.05 , Figure 6E ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Therefore , our findings indicate that SE - induced neutrophil infiltration into the PC may be correlated to <extra_id_0> TNF-alpha <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> - mediated vasogenic edema formation .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
