{"text": "Although the transcription factor <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> binds to a core NF-kappaB binding motif in the HIV-1 LTR enhancer region of subtype B , when two thymines ( TT ) are changed to cytosines ( CC ) in the proximal NF-kappaB binding motif ( named N5-Mut ) ( bottom of Figure 1B ) , the binding of <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> can be disrupted while leaving binding of NF-kappaB unperturbed [ 31 ] .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We examined the requirement of <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> for MTb - induced LTR activity by transfecting a wild-type and NFAT5 mutant LTR reporter construct into THP-1 cells , followed by stimulation with an MTb lysate .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "As shown in Figure 1B , in the absence of MTb lysate stimulation the activity of the NFAT5 binding site - mutant LTR was significantly reduced ( p < 0.05 ) in comparison to the wild-type LTR .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "To determine whether MTb lysate stimulation directly enhances <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> expression in THP-1 cells , we stimulated cells for 8 or 24 hours or left them unstimulated and examined <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> protein levels by western blot .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "As shown in Figure 1C , we found that <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> protein levels steadily increased in response to MTb lysate stimulation , revealing that TLR engagement by MTb results in enhanced levels of <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , consistent with its playing a role in MTb - induced activation of the HIV-1 LTR .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
