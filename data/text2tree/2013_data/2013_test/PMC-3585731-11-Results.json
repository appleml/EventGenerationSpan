{"text": "In this study we investigated <extra_id_0> RIP1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> kinase - dependent signaling pathways using mouse fibrosarcoma L929 cells that die by necroptosis when treated with the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Altogether , our results suggest that Akt kinase is specifically engaged in signaling downstream from <extra_id_0> RIP1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> kinase , which leads to a selective increase in its phosphorylation on Thr308 , but not Ser473 .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "According to our model ( Fig . 9 ) , necroptosis - associated phosphorylation of Akt requires two distinct signals .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "A second , <extra_id_0> RIP1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> kinase - dependent input is required for Thr308 phosphorylation of Akt in response to caspase inhibition and is essential for the propagation of the necroptotic signal .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Using Akt inhibitors , knockdown of Akt isoforms , and the expression of Akt mutants , we showed that necroptotic activation of Akt is indispensable for this form of cell death in L929 cells .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We also investigated downstream Akt - dependent pathways that contribute to necroptosis .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "First , we demonstrated that selective necroptotic phosphorylation of Thr308 of Akt is sufficient to increase its activity towards a number of known substrates and Akt effector pathways such as the mTORC1 pathway , which , in turn , contributes to cell death .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Second , our data suggested that Akt activation provides a pivotal link connecting <extra_id_0> RIP1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> kinase to known downstream signaling and execution events in necroptotic L929 cells , namely , JNK activation and autocrine <extra_id_0> TNFalpha <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> synthesis , a critical event in necroptosis in L929 cells [ 15 ] .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Both of these off - target effects could inhibit basal Akt phosphorylation levels , precluding the use of SP600125 in this system .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "These new data led us to an unexpected , but important conclusion that <extra_id_0> c-Jun <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> is critical for necroptosis , while JNK activity may serve as a useful marker of pathway activation , but may be either redundant ( e.g . phosphorylation of <extra_id_0> c-Jun <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> on a site other than Ser63 may occur [ 44 ] ) or dispensable functionally .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
