{"text": "The secondary injury mechanism involves the initiation of an acute inflammatory response , including breakdown of blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) , brain edema , infiltration of peripheral blood cells , and activation of resident immunocompetent cells , as well as the release of numerous immune mediators such as interleukins and chemotactic factors [ 1 ] .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "And the subsequent inflammation leads to secondary damage not only in brain but also in other organs [ 2-4 ] .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor2 ( Nrf2 ) is a transcription factor that regulates many kinds of antioxidant genes .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "On the contrary , such inflammation can be extenuated through elevating the level of Nrf2 by its inducers , such as sulforaphane ( SFN ) [ 6 ] .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
