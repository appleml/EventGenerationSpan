{"text": "Previously , we reported that SMI-71 ( an endothelial barrier antigen ) immunoreactivity decreased in the PC 1 day after SE [ 5 ] .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Similarly , in 1 day-post SE animals of the saline-infused group , loss of SMI-71 immunoreactivity was detected in layer III / IV of the PC as compared to non-SE animals ( Figures 4B and 5C-E , p < 0.05 ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Thus , loss of SMI-71 immunoreactivity correlated with volume of vasogenic edema following SE .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "This reduction in SMI-71 was accompanied by increased <extra_id_0> p65 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> - Thr435 phosphorylation ( Figures 5C-D ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Therefore , the degree of SMI-71 immunoreactivity was inversely correlated to <extra_id_0> p65 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> - Thr435 phosphorylation with a linear coefficient of correlation of -0.6324 ( p < 0.05 ; Figure 4C ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In addition , s <extra_id_0> TNFp55R <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> infusion effectively alleviated <extra_id_0> p65 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> - Thr435 phosphorylation and preserved SMI-71 immunoreactivity in endothelial cells following SE , as compared to saline infusion ( p < 0.05 ; Figures 4A-B , 5D and 5F ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
