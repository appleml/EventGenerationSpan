{"text": "Because the human and mouse <extra_id_0> cebpb <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> 3 ' untranslated regions are not identical , these species - specific shRNAs can not knockdown expression of endogenous <extra_id_0> C/EBP-beta <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> when used on cells of the other species ; therefore we used the human CEBPB shRNA as a control in these experiments as in [ 38 ] .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
