{"text": "fmk , which can not induce necroptosis ( Fig . 2A ) , triggered only the initial , rapid Akt and JNK phosphorylation changes and not the delayed activation ( Fig . 4A ) , indicating that late , rather than early Akt phosphorylation correlates with necroptosis .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Secondly , we saw that the ability of the Akt inhibitor to protect cells from necroptosis rapidly declined after 6 hrs of stimulation with zVAD.fmk , <extra_id_0> TNFalpha <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> or <extra_id_0> bFGF <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> / zVAD.fmk and no protection was observed when the inhibitor was added at 9 hrs ( Fig . 4B , C ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
