{"text": "Given that macrophages , which are the primary target of MTb infection , are also a major reservoir of HIV-1 as infection progresses [ 40 ] , we next investigated whether MTb is able to directly enhance <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> mRNA expression in primary human MDM .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We prepared MDM from five normal donors , stimulated the cells with the MTb lysate or left them unstimulated , and measured <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> gene expression levels by quantitative real-time PCR at 24 and 48 hours .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We also investigated whether HIV-1 infection is capable of inducing <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> mRNA synthesis by infecting MDM with live or heat - inactivated R5-tropic representatives of subtype B ( HIV-1Bal ) , C ( HIV-198IN22 ) , or E ( HIV-192TH64 ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "As shown in Figure 2A , stimulation with MTb lysate significantly increased <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> mRNA levels at 24 ( p < 0.05 ) and 48 ( p < 0.01 ) hours , whereas infection with viable or heat - inactivated HIV-1 isolates did not increase <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> mRNA levels ( Figure 2A ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Thus , MTb specifically enhances <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> mRNA expression in human MDM , and this response continues to increase for at least 48 hours post - stimulation ( Figure 2A ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
