{"text": "To compare the functional impact of MTb stimulation on subtype - specific HIV-1 LTR activity , we first constructed reporter plasmids containing viral subtype B , C , and E LTRs ( -208 to + 64 nt relative to the transcription start site ) linked to the firefly <extra_id_0> luciferase <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> reporter gene .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Upon stimulation , the B , C , and E LTR - driven reporters demonstrated a significant enhancement in <extra_id_0> luciferase <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> activity ( Figure 1A ) and the magnitude of this effect was subtype - specific .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Subtype C LTRs displayed the strongest activity , while the LTRs from subtype E isolates consistently showed the weakest activity ( Figure 1A ) , consistent with previous studies demonstrating subtype - specific LTR activity that used <extra_id_0> TNF <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> as a stimulus [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
