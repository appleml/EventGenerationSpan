{"text": "It has been proved that Nrf2 depletion enhances inflammatory process through activation of NF-kappaB in the brain after TBI , but little is known about the relationship between Nrf2 and NF-kappaB in astrocytes after TBI .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Hence , we used primary cultured astrocytes from either Nrf2 wildtype or knockout mice to study the influence of Nrf2 on the activation of NF-kappaB and expression of proinflammatory cytokines in a model of TBI in vitro .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Primary cultured astrocytes were scratched to mimic the traumatic injury in vitro .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Then the DNA - binding activity of NF-kappaB was evaluated by EMSA .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The mRNA and protein levels of TNF-alpha , <extra_id_0> IL-1beta <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , <extra_id_0> IL-6 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , and <extra_id_0> MMP9 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> were also evaluated .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Gelatin zymography was performed to detect the activity of <extra_id_0> MMP9 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The activity of NF-kappaB and expression of proinflammatory cytokines mentioned above were upregulated at 24 h after scratch .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The expression and activity of <extra_id_0> MMP9 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> were also elevated .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "And such tendency was much more prominent in Nrf2 KO astrocytes than that in WT astrocytes .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "These results suggest that the absence of Nrf2 may induce more aggressive inflammation through activation of NF-kappaB and downstream proinflammatory cytokines in astrocytes .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
