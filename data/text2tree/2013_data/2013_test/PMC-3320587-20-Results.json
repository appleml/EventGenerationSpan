{"text": "As shown in Figure 1 , the subtype C LTR was the most active of the HIV-1 LTR subtypes in the reporter assays .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Subtype C LTRs generally have three functional NF-kappaB sites in their LTRs , and subtype C is the predominant viral subtype in the African and Asian HIV-1 epidemics where MTb co-infection is extremely common [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 52 ] .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We thus next extended our analysis of the role of <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> in MTb / HIV-1 co-infection to a subtype C isolate .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We first constructed an infectious molecular clone of the HIV-1 subtype C primary isolate HIV-198IN22 , which has two NFAT5 binding sites in its LTR and three NF-kappaB sites ( Figure 6A ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We disrupted the two NFAT5 binding sites by changing the TT of each site to CC to create a mutant virus that we named HIV-198IN22-N5-Mut .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Bulk PBMC from four normal donors were infected overnight with 1000 TCID50 of wild-type HIV-198IN22 or HIV-198IN22-N5-Mut and the cultures were then co-infected with MTb CDC1551 or left infected with virus alone .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "At day 11 post-viral infection , wild-type HIV-198IN22 replication was greater , but not significantly so , as compared to replication of HIV-198IN22 NFAT5-Mut ( Figure 6B ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "However , in the context of MTb co-infection , wild-type HIV-198IN22 replication was significantly increased ( p < 0.05 ) at day 11 over HIV-198IN22 NFAT5-Mut replication ( Figure 6C ) , indicating that the absence of NFAT5 binding sites was particularly detrimental to virus replication in the presence of MTb co-infection .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Thus , even when three functional NF-kappaB binding sites are present in the LTR , as in the HIV-1 subtype C infectious clone studied here , disruption of <extra_id_0> NFAT5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> binding to the LTR impairs virus replication in response to MTb co-infection .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
