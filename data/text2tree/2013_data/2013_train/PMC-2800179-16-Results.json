{"text": "Preliminary observations by enumeration of THP-1 cells exposed to different concentrations of native and dCGN ( 10 and 40 kDa ) during 2 , 5 and 7 days , showed a decline in cell number ( data not shown ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "This suggested that dCGN might cause an alteration in the cell cycle .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry showed an accumulation of THP-1 cells in G0 / G1 phase , which was associated with a decrease number of cells in the S phase ( Fig . 3A ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The percentage of cells in the G0 / G1 phase was 45.2 % for control cells , 62.6 % for C10 dCGN ( at 2 mg / ml ) , and 64.2 % for C40 dCGN-treated cells ( at 2 mg / ml ) ( Fig . 3B ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The effect of dCGN on cell cycle was dose - dependent ( Fig . 3B ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Neither native nor dCGN had an effect on the number of cells in the G2 / M phase ( Fig . 3 ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "This effect is not due to cytotoxicity of dCGN even at the highest concentration ( i.e . 2 mg / ml ) since cell viability was not affected ( data not shown ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
