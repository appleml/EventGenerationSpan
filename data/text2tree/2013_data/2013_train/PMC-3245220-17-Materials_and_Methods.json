{"text": "Monocytes were transfected using the human monocyte Amaxa nucleofector kit ( Lonza Walkersville Inc , Walkersville , MD ) as previously described [ 51 ] .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Briefly , monocytes were resuspended in Amaxa Nucleofactor solution at a density of 20x106 cells / ml , and 2 microg of total plasmid DNA 100 nM of <extra_id_0> PKCalpha siRNA <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> or control siRNA was added and transfected using program Amaxa Y-01 .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "For co-transfection studies , <extra_id_0> PKCalpha <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> or NF-kappaB <extra_id_0> p65 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> constructs were mixed at a ratio of 5 : 1 with the reporter plasmid .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Immediately after transfection , cells were washed with 1 ml of RPMI medium containing 2 mM glutamine and 10 % FBS or serum free LGM medium ( Lonza Walkersville Inc . ) then plated at 4x105 cells / well in 24-well plates .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The original medium was replaced by serum free LGM medium without or with M-CSF ( 100 ng / ml ) one hour later .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The next day , cell-free supernatants were collected for the SEAP analysis .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Cells were stained with <extra_id_0> Annexin V <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> / propidium iodide ( PI ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "For the inhibition studies , cells were pre-incubated with inhibitor for 30 minutes in X-vivo medium prior to the addition of M-CSF .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
