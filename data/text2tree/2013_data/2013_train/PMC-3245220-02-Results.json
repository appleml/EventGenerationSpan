{"text": "In contrast , after transiently transfecting human MDMs with pNF-kappaB-SEAP constructs containing four NF-kappaB consensus binding sequences , M-CSF treatment of the transfected cells resulted in a 2.3-fold increase in SEAP release in the culture media compared to PBS ( vehicle ) - treated transfected MDMs ( Figure 1B ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
