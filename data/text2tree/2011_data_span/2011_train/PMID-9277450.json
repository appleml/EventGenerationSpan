{"text": "The expression of many genes for which products are involved in inflammation is controlled by the transcriptional regulator nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappa B . Because surfactant protein ( SP ) A is involved in local host defense in the lung and alters immune cell function by modulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines as well as surface proteins involved in inflammation , we hypothesized that SP-A exerts its action , at least in part , via activation of NF-kappa B .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
