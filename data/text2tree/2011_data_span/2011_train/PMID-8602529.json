{"text": "A trapoxin affinity matrix was used to isolate two nuclear proteins that copurified with histone deacetylase activity .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Both proteins were identified by peptide microsequencing , and a complementary DNA encoding the histone deacetylase catalytic subunit ( <extra_id_0> HD1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> ) was cloned from a human Jurkat T cell library .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "As the predicted protein is very similar to the yeast transcriptional regulator <extra_id_0> Rpd3p <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , these results support a role for histone deacetylase as a key regulator of eukaryotic transcription .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
