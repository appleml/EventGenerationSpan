{"text": "Ascorbic acid ( ascorbate or vitamin C ) has been shown to suppress the induction of HIV in latently infected T lymphocytic cells following stimulation with a tumor promoter ( PMA ) and inflammatory cytokine ( <extra_id_0> TNF-alpha <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "To assess whether this inhibition was mediated via modulation of the cellular transcription factor , NF-kappa B , we carried out gel shift analysis on nuclear extracts prepared under different conditions of cell stimulation in the presence or absence of ascorbate , N - acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , or zidovudine ( AZT ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Pretreatment of ACH-2 T cells by NAC followed by stimulation with PMA , <extra_id_0> TNF-alpha <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , or hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) resulted in strong suppression of NF-kappa B activation .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
