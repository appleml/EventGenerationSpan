{"text": "In 1991 , we demonstrated , using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , that 3 different factors ( termed B1 , B2 and B3 ) with affinity for the KB - enhancer target sequence were specifically detected in nuclear extracts from HIV1-infected monocytes and macrophages .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The B2 factor was induced in the nuclei of these cells only upon HIV1 infection .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The B3 factor was only slightly evident in nuclei of uninfected cells but was readily detectable in nuclei of infected monocytes .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Its expression remained very low in nuclei of HIV1-infected macrophages .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In this paper , we demonstrate that the B2 factor is expressed in the cytosol of monocytes and macrophages as a DNA - binding protein , indicating that it is not associated with an inhibitor ( IKB ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "This factor remained clustered in the cytosol and was translocated to the nuclei only after HIV1 infection .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The B3 factor is detected in the cytosol only when cells are HIV1-infected .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
