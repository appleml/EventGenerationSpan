{"text": "T cell activation results in high levels of HIV replication and is thought to be one mechanism leading to the conversion from latent to active viral infection .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In HIV-1 , the sequences that respond to these signaling events are found in the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and comprise the transcriptional enhancer , which contains two conserved binding sites for the nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The corresponding region in the second AIDS retrovirus , HIV-2 , contains a conserved and a divergent NF kappa B binding site .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We demonstrate that the HIV-1 LTR responds better than the HIV-2 LTR to T cell activation signals .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "These qualitative differences in the response to T cell activation are reproduced not only when HIV-1 or HIV-2 enhancers are placed upstream of a heterologous promoter but also when these enhancers are switched between their respective LTR .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In electrophoretic mobility shift assays , NF kappa B binds to both conserved sites in the HIV-1 transcriptional enhancer and only to the single conserved site in the HIV-2 transcriptional enhancer .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Instead of NF kappa B , the <extra_id_0> activator protein 3 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> binds to the divergent site in HIV-2 .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Binding binds <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Theme activator protein 3 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In conclusion , HIV-1 and HIV-2 are differentially regulated by T cell activation signals , and this difference may account for the longer period of viral latency observed with HIV-2 than with HIV-1 infection .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
