{"text": "In the present work , we investigated the molecular events leading to NF-kappa B activation by <extra_id_0> TNF alpha <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> in a human T cell line ( Jurkat ) and its subclone JCT6 , which presents a deficiency in the PKA transduction pathway .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We found that in both cell lines , both phorbol ester and <extra_id_0> TNF alpha <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> were able to activate NF-kappa B .
