{"text": "Cell culture experiments demonstrated that the natural variant with four <extra_id_0> Sp1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> sites had a slightly higher promoter activity and viral replication rate than the isogenic control LTR with three <extra_id_0> Sp1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> sites .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
