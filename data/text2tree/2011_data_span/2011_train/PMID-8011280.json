{"text": "Nevertheless , its properties seem to be most extensively exploited in cells of the immune system .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Among these properties are NF-kappa B 's rapid posttranslational activation in response to many pathogenic signals , its direct participation in cytoplasmic / nuclear signaling , and its potency to activate transcription of a great variety of genes encoding immunologically relevant proteins .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In vertebrates , five distinct DNA binding subunits are currently known which might extensively heterodimerize , thereby forming complexes with distinct transcriptional activity , DNA sequence specificity , and cell type - and cell stage - specific distribution .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The activity of DNA binding NF-kappa B dimers is tightly controlled by accessory proteins called I kappa B subunits of which there are also five different species currently known in vertebrates .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
