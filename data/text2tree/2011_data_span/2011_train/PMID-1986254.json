{"text": "In striking contrast to the mouse Ig heavy-chain enhancer , in which the octamer motif acts as a B-cell - specific enhancer element , the human enhancer contains an octamerlike sequence with one base substitution which bound octamer - binding proteins with only very low affinity and showed no enhancer activity of its own .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
