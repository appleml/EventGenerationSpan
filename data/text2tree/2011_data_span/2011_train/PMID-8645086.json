{"text": "We found that this latently infected cell line with heat shock at 42 degrees C for 2 h resulted in a high level of HIV-1 production without addition of any cytokines .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Although the <extra_id_0> TNF-alpha <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> level in culture supernatants was below the sensitivity of an ELISA assay system , addition of anti - <extra_id_0> TNF-alpha <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> antibody in culture medium could partially suppress the heat shock induced HIV-1 production .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
