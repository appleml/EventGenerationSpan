{"text": "Here we investigated the impact of retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) , retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) , and of the c-erbA / thyroid hormone ( T3 ) receptor ( c-erbA / TR ) on growth and differentiation of erythroid cells using an in vitro culture system of <extra_id_0> stem cell factor <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> - dependent erythroid progenitors .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "RXR , RAR , and c-erbA / TR - specific ligands were found to induce erythroid - specific gene expression and to accelerate erythroid differentiation in culture , with T3 being most effective .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Furthermore , while ligand - activated c-erbA / TR accelerated differentiation , unliganded c-erbA / TR effectively blocked differentiation and supported sustained progenitor growth in culture .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Thus , c-erbA / TR appears to act as a binary switch affecting erythroid cell fate : unliganded c-erbA / TR supports growth while ligand - activated c-erbA / TR induces differentiation .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Additionally , to determine the impact of RXR for erythroid cell development , dominant interfering mutant RXRs , lacking the transcriptional activator functions AF-1 and AF-2 , or AF-2 only , or the entire DNA - binding domain , were introduced into erythroid progenitor cells via recombinant retrovirus vectors and analyzed for RXR - specific effects .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "It was found that expression of wild-type RXR and of the RXR mutants devoid of AF-1 and / or AF-2 supported a transient outgrowth of erythroid cells .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In marked contrast , expression of the dominant interfering deltaDNA - binding domain RXR , containing a deletion of the entire DNA - binding domain , was incompatible with erythroid cell growth in vitro , suggesting a pivotal role of RXR for erythroid cell development .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
