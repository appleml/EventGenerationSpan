{"text": "Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ( HIV-1 ) transcription is dependent on the interaction of host-cell transcription factors with cis - regulatory DNA elements within the viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Much attention has focused on the series of sequence elements upstream of the transcriptional initiation site in the U3 region of the LTR including the <extra_id_0> Sp1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> and NF-kappaB binding sites .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Recent studies , however , demonstrate that the transcribed 5'-untranslated leader region ( 5'-UTR ) also contains important transcriptional elements .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "These regulatory elements situated downstream of transcription interact with constitutive and inducible transcription factors , mediate transmission of cellular activation signals , and are important for efficient HIV-1 transcription and replication .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The 5'-UTR contains binding sites for the transcription factors AP-1 , NF-kappaB , NF-AT , IRF , and <extra_id_0> Sp1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Mutations in these binding sites can interfere with the viral response to cell activation signals , decrease LTR transcription , and inhibit viral replication .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The 5'-UTR also interacts with a specific nucleosome that is rapidly displaced during transcriptional activation of the latent provirus .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We propose that the inducible transcription factor binding sites in the 5'-UTR comprise a downstream enhancer domain that can function independent of , or in concert with , the LTR promoter to rapidly increase latent proviral transcription in response to cell activation signals .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In this review , we describe the host-cell transcription factors that interact with the 5'-UTR and discuss their role in the transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 gene expression .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
