{"text": "The major goal of this study was to determine whether the mycobacterial cell wall component mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan ( ManLAM ) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M . tuberculosis ) could activate transcription of HIV-1 in T cells with the use of an in vitro cell culture system .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Using the 1G5 cell line harbouring the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1 LTR , it was first found that culture protein filtrates ( CFP ) from M . tuberculosis or purified ManLAM could activate HIV-1 LTR - dependent gene expression unlike similarly prepared CFP extracts devoid of ManLAM .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The implication of protein tyrosine kinase ( s ) , protein kinase A and / or protein kinase C was highlighted by the abrogation of the ManLAM - mediated activation of HIV-1 LTR - driven gene expression using herbimycin A and H7 .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
