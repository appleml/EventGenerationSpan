{"text": "Employing the EBV-transformed human B cell line SKW6.4 , we demonstrate that platelet - activating factor significantly alters membrane phospholipid metabolism indicated by the incorporation of 32P into phosphatidylcholine , phosphatidylinositol , and phosphatidic acid but not significantly into phosphatidylethanolamine at concentrations ranging from 10 ( -9 ) to 10 ( -6 ) M .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The inactive precursor , lyso-platelet - activating factor , at a concentration as high as 10 ( -7 ) M had no effect on any of the membrane phospholipids .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We also show that platelet - activating factor from 10 ( -12 ) to 10 ( -6 ) M induced rapid and significant elevation in intracellular calcium levels , whereas lyso-platelet - activating factor was again ineffective .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
