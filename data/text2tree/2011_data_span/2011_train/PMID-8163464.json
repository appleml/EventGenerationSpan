{"text": "In this study we have identified the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor ( PPAR ) as a new thyroid hormone receptor ( THR ) auxiliary nuclear protein , heterodimerizing with THR in solution .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Although these heterodimers do not recognize a classical thyroid hormone response element ( TRE ) characterized by direct repeat separated by four nucleotides ( DR+4 ) , PPAR behaves as a dominant negative regulator of thyroid hormone ( TH ) action .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "However , a TH - dependent positive effect is elicited by selective interaction of the THR beta-PPAR but not the THR alpha-PPAR heterodimer with a novel TRE ( DR+2 ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The critical region of THR beta was mapped to 3 amino acids in the distal box of the DNA binding domain .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Hence , PPAR can positively or negatively influence TH action depending on TRE structure and THR isotype .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
