{"text": "The protein kinase D ( PKD ) serine / threonine kinase family has three members : <extra_id_0> PKD1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , <extra_id_0> PKD2 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> and <extra_id_0> PKD3 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Most cell types express at least two PKD isoforms but PKD enzymes are especially highly expressed in haematopoietic cells , where they are activated in response to antigen receptors stimulation [ 2 , 3 ] .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "A conserved signalling pathway linking antigen receptors to PKDs involves the activation of PLCgamma and the subsequent production of diacylglycerol ( DAG ) which stimulates classical and / or novel protein kinase Cs ( PKC ) that phosphorylate two key regulatory serine residues in the activation loop of PKD kinases [ 3-6 ] .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The N-terminal regulatory region of PKD enzymes contains a DAG binding domain and direct binding of DAG also contributes to <extra_id_0> PKD1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> activation [ 7 ] as well as regulating the spatial location of PKD enzymes within cells [ 8-12 ] .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Binding binding <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Theme PKD1 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Positive_regulation contributes <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Theme activation <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Cause binding <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Positive_regulation activation <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Theme PKD1 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Expression of mutant catalytically inactive and constitutively activated PKDs can also modify Golgi function , cell adhesion and cell motility ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In particular , PKDs have been widely linked to the activation of the NFkappaB transcription factor and in regulating cell survival during oxidative stress [ 17 , 21-23 ] .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "An essential role for PKD enzymes in regulating class II histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) , enzymes that repress <extra_id_0> MEF2 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> - dependent gene transcription , has also been demonstrated [ 1 , 26-28 ] .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "To investigate the biological role of PKDs we have generated DT40 B cell lines that lack expression of one or more members of the PKD family [ 1 ] , allowing us to investigate the function ( s ) of PKD isoforms following B cell antigen receptor ( BCR ) stimulation , as well addressing the issue of functional redundancy between the different PKD family members .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
