{"text": "All rats developed diarrhea during degraded carrageenan administration and gross evidence of blood was frequently detected in the stools .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Colon length dramatically decreased in all treated rats with a more pronounced effect being observed in the 40 kDa dCGN treated group ( Fig . 1A ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Furthermore , prolonged exposure to 40 kDa dCGN resulted in high macroscopic and histological scores of inflammation ( Fig . 1B , C ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Only weak <extra_id_0> myeloperoxidase <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> activity was detected in both control and dCGN-treated groups ( Fig . 1D ) , indicating that granulocytes did not play a major role in the inflammation at that stage .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Histological examination revealed various degrees of mucosal inflammation .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Rats treated with 10 kDa dCGN showed edema , epithelium atrophy and slight lymphocyte infiltration ( data not shown ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "These symptoms were totally absent in the colon of control rats ( Fig . 1E ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "More severe mucosal injuries including ulceration , hyperplastic epithelium , crypt distortion and a strong macrophage infiltration , were observed in the 40 kDa dCGN-treated rats ( Fig . 1F ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "No sulphated polysaccharides were detected by toluidine blue staining of colon mucosa from rats treated with either the 10 or 40 kDa dCGN ( not shown ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Although we can not exclude that dCGN mat not have retained in the section during the histology procedure , this indicates that these polymers may not have been phagocytosed .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
