{"text": "Two preparations of degraded carrageenan with low , ( ~10 kDa ; C10 ) , and medium , ( ~40 kDa ; C40 ) molecular weight were prepared from native iota-carrageenan extracted from Euchema spinosum ( generously provided by Sanofi Biosystems Industry , Boulogne-Billancourt , France ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Native carrageenan was dissolved in distilled water ( 5 % w / v ) under vigorous stirring and heated to 60degreesC .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Then , the carrageenan solution was submitted to two different treatments to obtain both low and medium molecular weight fractions .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Briefly , for the low molecular weight fraction , carrageenan solution was hydrolyzed with 0.3 % ( v / v ) concentrated sulphuric acid for 15 min at 80degreesC .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "After neutralization with NaOH 4N , the solution was ultra filtered through a hollow fibre cartridge with MW cut-off 5 kDa , ( Amicon Inc , Beverly , USA ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "For the medium molecular weight fraction , the carrageenan solution was hydrolyzed with 0.3 % ( v / v ) concentrated sulphuric acid for 30 min at 60degreesC .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "After neutralization , the supernatant was ultra filtered ( MW cut-off 100 kDa ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The filtrate was submitted to a second ultra filtration ( MW cut-off 5 kDa ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Both preparations of dCGN were precipitated with 4 volumes of 95 % ethanol , dried at room temperature and ground to small particles ( 1 mm in diameter ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Using gel-permeation chromatography in combination with light scattering measurements ( see Viebke et al . [ 21 ] ) , it was confirmed that the low fraction had an average molecular weight of 10 kDa , and the medium fraction of 40 kDa .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The sulphate content of polysaccharides in both fractions was measured following the method of Quemener et al . [ 22 ] .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Finally , the absence of polysaccharide structure modifications in the two fractions was confirmed using 2H-NMR spectroscopy .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The absence of LPS contamination in the two fractions was confirmed using the e-Toxate ( R ) kit ( Sigma , St Quentin Fallavier , France ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Before use in cell culture , the two fractions were dissolved in complete medium during 30 min at 56degreesC .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
