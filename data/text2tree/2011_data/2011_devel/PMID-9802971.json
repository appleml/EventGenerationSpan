{"text": "Using human T lymphocytes and T cell lines , we show that progesterone , at concentrations found in the placenta , rapidly and reversibly blocks voltage-gated and calcium - activated K+ channels ( KV and KCa , respectively ) , resulting in depolarization of the membrane potential .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "As a result , Ca2+ signaling and nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) - driven gene expression are inhibited .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Progesterone acts distally to the initial steps of T cell receptor ( TCR ) - mediated signal transduction , since it blocks sustained Ca2+ signals after thapsigargin stimulation , as well as oscillatory Ca2+ signals , but not the Ca2+ transient after TCR stimulation .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "K+ channel blockade by progesterone is specific ; other steroid hormones had little or no effect , although the progesterone antagonist RU 486 also blocked KV and KCa channels .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
