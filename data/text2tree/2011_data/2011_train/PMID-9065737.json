{"text": "In this paper , we demonstrate that the activation of NF-kappaB by LPS in a promonocytic cell line ( U937 ) followed a rather slow kinetics , depending on the rate of <extra_id_0> IkappaB-alpha <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> inhibitor hydrolysis .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
