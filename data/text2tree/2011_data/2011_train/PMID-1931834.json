{"text": "In this study we demonstrate that a subfragment ( C26 ) in the region between the 21-bp elements is involved in trans-activation by <extra_id_0> p40tax <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , possibly through binding to an NF-kappa B-like nuclear factor or factors .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
