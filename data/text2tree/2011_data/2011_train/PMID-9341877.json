{"text": "The visualization of heavy and light chain genes in B-lymphoid cells showed that the three Ig genes are differentially and nonrandomly distributed in different nuclear subvolumes : the kappa genes were found to be preferentially confined to an outer nuclear volume , whereas the gamma and lambda genes consistently occupied more central positions within the nucleus , the lambda genes being more interior when compared with the gamma genes .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The data further show that these overall topographical distributions are independent of gene transcriptional activity and are conserved in different cell types .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Although subtle gene movements within those defined topographical regions can not be excluded by this study , the results indicate that tissue specificity of gene expression is not accompanied by drastic changes in gene nuclear topography , rather suggesting that gene organization within the nucleus may be primarily dependent on structural constraints imposed on the respective chromosomes .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
