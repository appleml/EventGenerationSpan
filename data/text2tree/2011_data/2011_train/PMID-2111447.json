{"text": "To determine whether enhancer elements in addition to the highly conserved octamer ( OCTA ) - nucleotide motif are important for lymphoid - specific expression of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) gene , we have investigated the effect of mutating the binding site for a putative additional lymphoid - specific transcription factor , designated <extra_id_0> NF-microB <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , in the murine IgH enhancer .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Binding binding <extra_id_0> Theme NF-microB <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We demonstrate that the <extra_id_0> NF-microB <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> - binding site plays a critical role in the IgH enhancer , because mutation of the microB DNA motif decreased transcriptional activity of the IgH enhancer in cells of the B-cell lineage but not in nonlymphoid cells .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "This effect was comparable to or even stronger than the effect of a mutation in the OCTA site .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Moreover , combined mutation of both microB and OCTA sites further reduced enhancer activity in lymphoid cells .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Interestingly , alteration of either the microB or E3 site in a 70-base - pair fragment of the IgH enhancer that lacks the binding site for OCTA abolished enhancer activity in lymphoid cells completely .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
