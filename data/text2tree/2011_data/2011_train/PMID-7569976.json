{"text": "Glucocorticoids are among the most potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "They inhibit synthesis of almost all known cytokines and of several cell surface molecules required for immune function , but the mechanism underlying this activity has been unclear .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Here it is shown that glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activation in mice and cultured cells .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "This inhibition is mediated by induction of the <extra_id_0> I kappa B alpha <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> inhibitory protein , which traps activated NF-kappa B in inactive cytoplasmic complexes .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Because NF-kappa B activates many immunoregulatory genes in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli , the inhibition of its activity can be a major component of the anti-inflammatory activity of glucocorticoids .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
