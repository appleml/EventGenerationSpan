{"text": "Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) is associated with an increased rate of sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) type 1 , and Gardnerella vaginalis is frequently isolated from the genital tracts of women with BV .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "G . vaginalis lysates were found to significantly stimulate HIV expression in monocytoid cells .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
