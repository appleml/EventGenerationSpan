{"text": "We conclude that : ( i ) suppression of specific transcription factor functions can potentially serve as a marker of exposure to oxidative stress and its effects on human lymphocytes ; ( ii ) lipid peroxidation is only detectable in human lymphocytes upon exposure to weak oxidative stress which does not induce catalase activity ; ( iii ) therefore , transcription factor DNA - binding activities are more sensitive to oxidative stress than lipid peroxidation .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
