{"text": "Transient expression analyses in cells of neuroglial and lymphocytic origin demonstrated that some of these LTRs had activities which varied significantly from the LAI LTR in U-373 MG cells ( an astrocytoma cell line ) as well as in Jurkat cells ( a <extra_id_0> CD4 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> - positive lymphocyte cell line ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
