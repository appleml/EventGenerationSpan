{"text": "To study the complexity and structural characteristics of zinc finger proteins expressed during human hematopoiesis and to isolate novel regulators of blood cell development , a degenerate oligonucleotide probe specific for a consensus zinc finger peptide domain was used to isolate 63 cDNA clones for Kruppel-related zinc finger genes from the human monoblast cell line U-937 .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "By extensive nucleotide sequence and Northern blot analysis , these cDNA clones were found to originate from approximately 42 different genes ( <extra_id_0> HZF 1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> - <extra_id_0> 42 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> ) of which only 8 have previously been described .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "The large number of individual genes represented among the 63 clones and their apparent non-cell-type - specific expression suggest that the majority of the Kruppel-related zinc finger genes are likely to be expressed in most human tissues .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Gene_expression expression <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Detailed structural analysis of the first 12 cDNAs ( <extra_id_0> HZF 1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> - <extra_id_0> 10 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> ) and a partial characterization of <extra_id_0> HZF 11 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> - <extra_id_0> 42 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> revealed that a common feature of human Kruppel-related zinc finger proteins is the presence of tandem arrays of zinc fingers ranging in number from 3 to over 20 that are preferentially located in the carboxy-terminal regions of the proteins .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
