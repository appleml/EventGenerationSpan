{"text": "Since the human genomic sterol regulatory element ( SRE ) has been shown to regulate various key genes involved in this phenomenon , the present study revealed the existence of a unique 47 kDa protein factor having affinity for this SRE sequence in lymphocytes from normal subjects , as well as its absence in lymphocytes from untreated CML patients .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
