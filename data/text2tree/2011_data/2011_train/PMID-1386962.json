{"text": "The work reviewed in this article separates T cell development into four phases .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "First is an expansion phase prior to TCR rearrangement , which appears to be correlated with programming of at least some response genes for inducibility .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "This phase can occur to some extent outside of the thymus .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "However , the profound T cell deficit of nude mice indicates that the thymus is by far the most potent site for inducing the expansion per se , even if other sites can induce some response acquisition .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Second is a controlled phase of TCR gene rearrangement .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The details of the regulatory mechanism that selects particular loci for rearrangement are still not known .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "It seems that the rearrangement of the TCR gamma loci in the gamma delta lineage may not always take place at a developmental stage strictly equivalent to the rearrangement of TCR beta in the alpha beta lineage , and it is not clear just how early the two lineages diverge .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In the TCR alpha beta lineage , however , the final gene rearrangement events are accompanied by rapid proliferation and an interruption in cellular response gene inducibility .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The loss of conventional responsiveness is probably caused by alterations at the level of signaling , and may be a manifestation of the physiological state that is a precondition for selection .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Third is the complex process of selection .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Whereas peripheral T cells can undergo forms of positive selection ( by antigen - driven clonal expansion ) and negative selection ( by abortive stimulation leading to anergy or death ) , neither is exactly the same phenomenon that occurs in the thymic cortex .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Negative selection in the cortex appears to be a suicidal inversion of antigen responsiveness : instead of turning on <extra_id_0> IL-2 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> expression , the activated cell destroys its own chromatin .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Negative_regulation inversion <extra_id_0> Theme responsiveness <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Positive_regulation responsiveness <extra_id_0> Theme turning <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Positive_regulation turning <extra_id_0> Theme expression <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Gene_expression expression <extra_id_0> Theme IL-2 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "It is interesting that in humans and rats , cortical thymocytes undergoing negative selection can still induce <extra_id_0> IL-2R alpha <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> expression and even be rescued in vitro , if exogenous <extra_id_0> IL-2 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> is provided .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Positive_regulation induce <extra_id_0> Theme expression <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Gene_expression expression <extra_id_0> Theme IL-2R alpha <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
