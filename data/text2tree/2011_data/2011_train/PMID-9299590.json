{"text": "Rel / NF-kappa B is a ubiquitous transcription factor that consists of multiple polypeptide subunits , and is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms that involve protein - protein interactions , phosphorylation , ubiquitination , proteolytic degradation , and nucleocytoplasmic translocation .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The sophisticated control of Rel / NF-kappa B activity is not surprising since this transcription factor is involved in a wide array of cellular responses to extracellular cues , associated with growth , development , apoptosis , and pathogen invasion .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Thus , it is not unexpected that this versatile cellular homeostatic switch would be affected by a variety of viral pathogens , which have evolved mechanisms to utilize various aspects of Rel / NF-kappa B activity to facilitate their replication , cell survival and possibly evasion of immune responses .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "This review will cover the molecular mechanisms that are utilized by mammalian oncogenic viruses to affect the activity of Rel / NF-kappa B transcription factors and the role of Rel / NF-kappa B in the regulation of viral gene expression and replication .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
