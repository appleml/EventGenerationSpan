{"text": "Over the past several years , mounting evidence has shown that immune tolerance in healthy individuals can be maintained by a population of T lymphocytes known as regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "As a component of this system , a protein known as <extra_id_0> Foxp3 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> has been shown to be absolutely required for the development and function of Tregs .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "While <extra_id_0> Foxp3 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> plays an important role in maintaining immune tolerance by blocking T cell proliferation and production of inflammatory proteins known as cytokines , little is known about the molecular mechanisms that are used by <extra_id_0> Foxp3 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> to accomplish these events .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The present study expands our understanding of how <extra_id_0> Foxp3 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> maintains a check on inappropriate immune responses by demonstrating that <extra_id_0> Foxp3 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> can block activation of key inducible proteins such as nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and cAMP - responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Since NF-kappaB and CREB are integrally involved in controlling cell cycle progression , inflammatory cytokine production , and the replication of numerous viruses at the level of transcription , understanding the mechanisms by which <extra_id_0> Foxp3 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> functions to regulate cellular and viral gene expression may aid in the discovery of therapeutic approaches designed to rescue the expression and / or function of <extra_id_0> Foxp3 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , which have been found to be deficient in several autoimmune diseases and virus - induced disorders .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Gene_expression expression <extra_id_0> Theme Foxp3 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
