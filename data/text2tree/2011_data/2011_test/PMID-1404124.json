{"text": "<extra_id_0> Glucocorticoid receptor <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> concentrations in mononuclear leukocytes ( MNL ) in these patients were comparable with those in both other patients with SLE and healthy persons .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Improvement in urinary protein excretion and in disease activity , which was scored according to the SLE Disease Activity Index system of the University of Toronto , closely related to the <extra_id_0> glucocorticoid receptor <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> concentrations in MNL isolated from the corresponding patients .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
