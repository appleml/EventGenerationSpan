{"text": "These effects were specific in that the potentiated phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils was completely blocked by the <extra_id_0> glucocorticoid receptor <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> antagonist RU38486 , and glucocorticoids did not promote 5-day M phi ingestion of opsonized erythrocytes .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Similar glucocorticoid - mediated potentiation was observed with 5-day M phi uptake of alternative apoptotic \" targets \" ( eosinophils and Jurkat T cells ) and in uptake of apoptotic neutrophils by alternative phagocytes ( human glomerular mesangial cells and murine M phi elicited into the peritoneum or derived from bone marrow ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Importantly , methylprednisolone - mediated enhancement of the uptake of apoptotic neutrophils did not trigger the release of the chemokines <extra_id_0> IL-8 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> and <extra_id_0> monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
