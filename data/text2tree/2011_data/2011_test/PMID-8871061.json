{"text": "Therefore , we have studied the transcriptional regulation of <extra_id_0> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> ( <extra_id_0> ICAM-1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> ) as adhesion molecules are likely to play a causal role in inflammation in promoting cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We observed that in a monocytic ( U937 ) and a bronchial epithelial ( H292 ) cell-line dexamethasone strongly suppressed basal and induced <extra_id_0> ICAM-1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> expression .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Subsequent analysis of the human <extra_id_0> ICAM-1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> promoter has revealed that both 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) and <extra_id_0> tumour necrosis factor-alpha <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> ( <extra_id_0> TNF-alpha <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> ) upregulate <extra_id_0> ICAM-1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> expression through the presence of a nuclear factor ( NF-kappa B ) target sequence ( TGGAAATTCC ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "No glucocorticoid recognition sequences are present in this promoter region and dexamethasone is still able to repress transcription when the multimerized NF-kappa B sequence is transactivated by <extra_id_0> TNF-alpha <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> upon transfection in 293 cells .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We propose that direct interaction between the <extra_id_0> glucocorticoid receptor <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> and nuclear factor-kappa B factors is at least a partial explanation for the effects of this hormone in inflammatory diseases .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
