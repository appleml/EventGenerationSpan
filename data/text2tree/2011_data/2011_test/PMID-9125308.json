{"text": "The findings presented here link an atheogenic lipoprotein , LDL , with the induction of an adhesion molecule important in atherogenesis Human LDL induces the <extra_id_0> vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> ( <extra_id_0> VCAM-1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> ) transcriptionally with an increase in mRNA levels through activation of the VCAM promoter .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "After a 2-day incubation in LDL , the binding of NF-kappa B , which is believed to be a key oxidative-stress sensor for VCAM regulation , remains at basal level .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
