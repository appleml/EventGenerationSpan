{"text": "BACKGROUND : We reported on the constitutive interferon-gamma receptor ( IFN-gammaR ) expression on eosinophils .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "But signal transduction through IFN-gammaR on eosinophils remains to be elucidated .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In this study , we examined the involvement of the Jak / Stat pathway in the signaling of eosinophils after IFN-gammaR conjugation by the ligand binding .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "METHODS : Purified peripheral eosinophils were stimulated with IFN-gamma at 37 degrees C for 1-60 min .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Tyrosine phosphorylation of IFN-gammaR , <extra_id_0> Jak1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , <extra_id_0> Jak2 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , and <extra_id_0> Stat1alpha <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> was examined by immunoblotting .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "RESULTS : We show that binding of IFN-gamma to human eosinophils initiated a series of events that resulted in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of not only the <extra_id_0> IFN-gammaRalpha chain <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> but also <extra_id_0> Jak1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , <extra_id_0> Jak2 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , and <extra_id_0> Stat1alpha <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "CONCLUSION : These data indicate that IFN-gamma affects eosinophils through its specific receptor and utilizes the Jak / Stat pathway as its mode of signaling .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
