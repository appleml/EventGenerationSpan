{"text": "The immunosuppressants ciclosporin and FK506 block the Ca ( 2+ ) - dependent signal-transduction pathway emanating from the T-cell receptor , thereby inhibiting the activation of helper T cells .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Using these drugs as probes , chemists and biologists have uncovered several intracellular signalling molecules bridging the generation of second-messenger Ca2+ ions and the transcriptional activation of <extra_id_0> IL-2 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , among which are <extra_id_0> calmodulin <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , calcineurin and the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Hence , Ca2+ binds to <extra_id_0> calmodulin <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , leading to the binding of <extra_id_0> calmodulin <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> to calcineurin ; the activated calcineurin , in turn , may dephosphorylate the cytoplasmic subunit of NF-AT , resulting in its translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to form a competent transcriptional activator .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "As described by Jun Liu , these drugs manifest their effects in an unprecedented fashion .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "They do not directly intercept intracellular signalling molecules .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Instead , they form tight complexes with two different classes of abundant cytosolic receptors called immunophilins upon entering the cell , and consequently inhibit their peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase activities .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The two structurally distinct immunophilin-drug complexes bind to , and inhibit , the phosphatase activity of calcineurin .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
