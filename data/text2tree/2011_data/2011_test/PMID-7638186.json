{"text": "Interleukin 12 ( IL-12 ) is an important immunoregulatory cytokine whose receptor is a member of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We have recently demonstrated that stimulation of human T and natural killer cells with IL-12 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the Janus family tyrosine kinase <extra_id_0> JAK2 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> and <extra_id_0> Tyk2 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , implicating these kinases in the immediate biochemical response to IL-12 .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Recently , transcription factors known as STATs ( signal transducers and activators of transcription ) have been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated and activated in response to a number of cytokines that bind hematopoietin receptors and activate JAK kinases .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In this report we demonstrate that IL-12 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a recently identified STAT family member , <extra_id_0> STAT4 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , and show that <extra_id_0> STAT4 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> expression is regulated by T-cell activation .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Furthermore , we show that IL-12 stimulates formation of a DNA - binding complex that recognizes a DNA sequence previously shown to bind STAT proteins and that this complex contains <extra_id_0> STAT4 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "These data , and the recent demonstration of JAK phosphorylation by IL-12 , identify a rapid signal-transduction pathway likely to mediate IL-12 - induced gene expression .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
