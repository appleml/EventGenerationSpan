{"text": "In animal experiment , <extra_id_0> GCR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> of spleen lymphocytic cell was also measured in 18 aged rats and 9 young rats .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The results showed that <extra_id_0> GCR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> was significantly lower in the aged persons or rats than that in the young while the plasma cortisol level did n't change with aging .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "After the treatment with the regimen of Kidney-tonifying and Qi-invigorating , the <extra_id_0> GCR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> of the aged persons and rats was enhanced , and in this way , the function of the aged adrenal cortex was improved .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
