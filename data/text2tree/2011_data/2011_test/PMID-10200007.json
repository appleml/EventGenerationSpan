{"text": "BACKGROUND : In vivo regulation of the <extra_id_0> glucocorticoid receptor <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> ( <extra_id_0> GR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> ) by glucocorticoids provides a means of modulating sensitivity of targeted cells .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "OBJECTIVE : We sought to determine the in vivo modulation of <extra_id_0> GR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> mRNA expression by fluticasone propionate ( FP ) in subjects with mild asthma .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "METHODS : Ten atopic asthmatic subjects were treated with FP 250 microg twice daily for 4 weeks .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Before and after treatment , the patients underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy and sampling of venous blood for measurements of <extra_id_0> GR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> mRNA levels .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "A solution hybridization assay was used for quantitative analysis of <extra_id_0> GR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> mRNA .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In addition , a 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion and an <extra_id_0> adrenocorticotropic hormone <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> test before and after treatment with FP were performed .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "RESULTS : A high interindividual variation in <extra_id_0> GR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> mRNA expression was seen .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "However , we detected a significant reduction of the <extra_id_0> GR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> mRNA levels in the endobronchial biopsy specimens after FP treatment ( 36.6 +/- 23.1 and 25.0 +/- 10.9 amol <extra_id_0> GR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> mRNA / microg RNA , respectively ; P < .01 ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In the peripheral blood lymphocytes an even more striking downregulation of the <extra_id_0> GR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> by its cognate ligand was documented ( 30.3 +/- 26.5 and 8.8 +/- 5 amol <extra_id_0> GR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> mRNA / microg RNA , respectively ; P < .001 ) , possibly reflecting differences in glucocorticoid sensitivity between tissues .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "A small but significant reduction of the 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion was observed ( 233 +/- 109 and 157 +/- 66 nmol / L , respectively ; P < .01 ) , whereas the feedback regulation of glucocorticoid synthesis by means of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as assessed by the <extra_id_0> adrenocorticotropic hormone <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> test remained normal after treatment with FP .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "CONCLUSION : The results in this study confirm the potency of the inhaled corticosteroid FP and provide evidence for a considerable tissue - specific interindividual variation in the expression of the <extra_id_0> GR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
