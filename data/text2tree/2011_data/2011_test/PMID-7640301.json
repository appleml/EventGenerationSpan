{"text": "In the current study , cysteamine , an aminothiol compound with antioxidant activity , has been used to further investigate the role of oxidative signalling during lymphocyte activation .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Treatment of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes with cysteamine in vitro was found to inhibit proliferation in a dose - dependent manner , with essentially complete inhibition occurring at a dose of 400 microM .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "This inhibitory effect was limited to the first 2 h after mitogenic activation , localizing the time-frame of action of cysteamine to within the commitment period .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "It therefore was of interest to establish which , if any , commitment events were affected by oxidative signalling during cell cycle entry .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Taking the <extra_id_0> IL-2 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> gene as a candidate , we examined the effect of cysteamine treatment on early gene expression during lymphocyte activation , and on the activity of transcription factors AP-1 , NF-kappa B , NF-AT and <extra_id_0> Oct1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , whose functions are required for expression of the <extra_id_0> IL-2 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> mRNA .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Cysteamine treatment inhibited both expression of the <extra_id_0> IL-2 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> mRNA and secretion of <extra_id_0> IL-2 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> into the culture medium .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The inhibitory effect of cysteamine may be mediated at least in part by an effect on transcription factor function , as the DNA binding activities of AP-1 and NF-kappa B extracted from mitogen - stimulated cells were significantly inhibited by cysteamine treatment .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Interestingly , <extra_id_0> Oct1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> and NF-AT DNA binding activity were not affected by cysteamine treatment , suggesting that oxidative signalling processes operate in a selective manner .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The identification of regulatory proteins , such as transcription factors , as molecular targets for oxidative signalling provides further evidence to implicate oxidative signalling as being intimately involved in the G0 to G1 phase transition in T lymphocytes .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
