{"text": "As this phosphorylation was independent of protein kinase C activity , we tested whether a calcium / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase ( CaM kinase ) might phosphorylate the <extra_id_0> Ets-1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> protein after elevation of intracellular free calcium concentrations .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
