{"text": "BACKGROUND : Abnormalities in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) - dependent phosphorylation system have been recently reported in patients with bipolar disorder .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We evaluated the immunoreactivity of the regulatory and catalytic subunits of cAMP - dependent protein kinase ( protein kinase A ) and 1 of its substrates , <extra_id_0> Rap1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , in platelets from untreated euthymic , manic , and depressed patients with bipolar disorder and healthy subjects .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "METHODS : Platelets were collected from 112 drug-free patients with bipolar disorder ( 52 euthymic , 29 depressed , and 31 manic ) and 62 healthy subjects .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The levels of cAMP - dependent protein kinase and <extra_id_0> Rap1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> were assessed by Western blot analysis , immunostaining , and computer-assisted imaging .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "RESULTS : The immunolabeling of the catalytic subunit of cAMP - dependent protein kinase was significantly different among groups ( P < .001 ) , with higher values in untreated depressed and manic patients with bipolar disorder compared with untreated euthymic patients with bipolar disorder and healthy subjects .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "No significant differences were found in the immunolabeling of the regulatory subunits ( type I and type II ) of cAMP - dependent protein kinase .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The immunolabeling of <extra_id_0> Rap1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> was significantly higher ( P < .001 ) in untreated euthymic , depressed , and manic patients than in healthy persons .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "CONCLUSIONS : Levels of <extra_id_0> Rap1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> and the catalytic subunit of cAMP - dependent protein kinase are altered in the platelets of bipolar patients .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
