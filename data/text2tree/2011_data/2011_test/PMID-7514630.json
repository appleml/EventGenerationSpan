{"text": "Tenascin ( TN ) is an extracellular matrix protein that is expressed widely in the fetus and sparingly in the adult , but reappears at high levels in certain areas of tissue insult such as tumor matrices and sites of wound healing .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We show here that soluble TN inhibits proliferation of human T cells in response to alpha CD3 Ab co-immobilized with the extracellular matrix protein <extra_id_0> fibronectin <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> ( <extra_id_0> FN <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "The presence of TN in culture medium does not detectably alter the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation resulting from T cell triggering with alpha CD3 , but at later time points prevents the appearance of functional NF-AT1 transcription factor complexes in T cell nuclear extracts .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "These findings are consistent with the postulated role for TN as a natural antagonist to <extra_id_0> FN <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> action , and suggest that T cell responses occurring at tissue sites in which TN is expressed could be influenced by its presence .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
