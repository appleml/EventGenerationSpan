{"text": "OBJECTIVE : We investigated the effect of DEP-PAHs on the release and mRNA expression of <extra_id_0> IL-8 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , <extra_id_0> MCP-1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , and <extra_id_0> RANTES <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> by PBMCs obtained from healthy subjects .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "RESULTS : Secretion of <extra_id_0> IL-8 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> and <extra_id_0> RANTES <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> increased in a dose - dependent manner with increasing concentrations of DEP-PAHs ( range , 0.5 ng to 50 ng / mL ) .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "On the contrary , the release of <extra_id_0> MCP-1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> was significantly inhibited , also in a dose - dependent manner .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Effects of DEP-PAHs became significant at 7 hours and up to 48 hours time culture for <extra_id_0> MCP-1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> , and up to 24 hours time culture for <extra_id_0> IL-8 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> and <extra_id_0> RANTES <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Moreover , supernatants from DEP-PAH - activated cells , compared with those of controls , exhibited a significantly enhanced chemotactic activity for neutrophils and eosinophils , which was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with anti - <extra_id_0> IL-8 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> and anti - <extra_id_0> RANTES <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> neutralizing antibodies , respectively .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "CONCLUSION : These findings suggest that the chemokine pathways are modulated by DEP-PAHs at the transcriptional level , reinforcing the idea that the development of inflammatory reactions might be affected by diesel exhaust emission .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
