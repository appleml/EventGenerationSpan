{"text": "OBJECTIVE : To investigate the long-term effects of treatment with low doses of flutamide on clinical and hormonal parameters , as well as on the <extra_id_0> androgen receptor <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> status , in hirsute women .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "DESIGN : Eighteen hirsute patients with regular menses were studied basally and during treatment with 125 mg flutamide , three times per day for 12 months .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
