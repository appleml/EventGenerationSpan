{"text": "A major difficulty in determination of <extra_id_0> glucocorticoid receptor <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> sites is the very complicated assay procedure .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Therefore , we describe a microtitre assay system for <extra_id_0> glucocorticoid receptors <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> which is a whole-cell competitive binding radioassay using [ 3H ] - dexamethasone as radioligand .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "This modification of a previously described protocol simplifies and reduces laboratory work and allows assay reproducibility to be controlled more reliably .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Thus enabled to perform the test on multiple blood samples in parallel , we investigated cardiac infarction patients over a 12-day period to test if <extra_id_0> glucocorticoid receptor <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> binding is altered in this 'stressful ' disease .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "On the first day of the disease , <extra_id_0> glucocorticoid receptor <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> capacity was significantly decreased without alteration of the receptor - ligand affinity , whereas on days 4 and 12 the number of receptor sites was normal again .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "This result fits well into the general observation of stress - induced down-regulation of immune responses .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
