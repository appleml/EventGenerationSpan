{"text": "In summary , our data demonstrated that in vitro glucan phosphate induced a transcription factor binding and a subsequent cytokine profile different from LPS and also from <extra_id_0> TSST-1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> and , moreover , switched a pro-inflammatory <extra_id_0> TSST-1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> - induced response to an <extra_id_0> IL-1RA <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> - mediated anti-inflammatory reaction .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Our results also generated new insights into a very complex interplay of transcription factor binding to various known and newly identified sites in the <extra_id_0> IL-1RA <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> promoter ( Fig . 8 ) , which can be regulated differentially by a fungal carbohydrate .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Together with the in vivo studies [ 22 , 37 ] , our findings might support the concept of protective effects mediated by glucan phosphate in pro-inflammatory conditions , especially with a dysregulated <extra_id_0> IL-1beta <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> / <extra_id_0> IL-1RA <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> ratio [ 52 , 53 ] .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
