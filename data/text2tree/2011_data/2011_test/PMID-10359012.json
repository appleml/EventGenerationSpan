{"text": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathway contributes to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) - induced mononuclear differentiation in the human myeloblastic leukemia ML-1 cells .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Upon TPA treatment , the activity of <extra_id_0> ERK1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> and <extra_id_0> ERK2 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> rapidly increased , with maximal induction between 1 and 3 h , while <extra_id_0> ERK2 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> protein levels remained constant .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The activity of <extra_id_0> JNK1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> was also significantly induced , with <extra_id_0> JNK1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> protein levels increasing moderately during exposure to TPA .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Treatment of cells with PD98059 , a specific inhibitor of mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) , inhibited TPA - induced <extra_id_0> ERK2 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> activity .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Furthermore , PD98059 completely blocked the TPA - induced differentiation of ML-1 cells , as assessed by a number of features associated with mononuclear differentiation including changes in morphology , nonspecific esterase activity , phagocytic ability , NADPH oxidase activity , mitochondrial respiration , and <extra_id_0> c-jun <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> mRNA inducibility .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
