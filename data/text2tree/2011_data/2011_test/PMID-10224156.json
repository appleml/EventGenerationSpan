{"text": "Cells from the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 differentiate towards a macrophage-like phenotype when stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate -13- acetate ( PMA ) , 1 , 25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 , and various other agents .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We demonstrate here that the expression of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase ( ASM ; E.C.3.1.4.12 ) is induced during this process and is strongly elevated in differentiated THP-1 cells , as well as in differentiated human mononuclear phagocytes .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Using Northern blotting , RNase protection assay , and nuclear run-on analyses , we show that the up-regulation of ASM expression is regulated mainly at the level of transcription and that new protein synthesis is required for enhanced ASM activity .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
