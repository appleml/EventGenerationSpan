{"text": "Acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia ( M7 ) and transient myeloproliferative disorder in Down 's syndrome ( TMD ) are characterized by rapid growth of abnormal blast cells which express megakaryocytic markers .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Erythroid - specific mRNAs encoding gamma-globin and erythroid <extra_id_0> delta-aminolevulinate synthase <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> were found to be expressed in blasts from most of these cases , indicating that majorities of the blasts in M7 and TMD cases have erythroid and megakaryocytic phenotypes .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We also found that mRNAs encoding <extra_id_0> GATA-1 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> and <extra_id_0> GATA-2 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> are expressed in all these cases .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
