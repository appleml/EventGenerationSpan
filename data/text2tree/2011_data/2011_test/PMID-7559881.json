{"text": "We have compared the frequency of a restriction fragment length polymorphism ( Bsm I ) associated with different alleles of the <extra_id_0> VDR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> gene in a group of 33 well characterized absorptive hypercalciuric patients and a group of 36 normal race - and age-matched control subjects .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "The coding region of <extra_id_0> VDR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> messenger RNA was also normal , as determined by both DNA sequence analysis and chemical mismatch cleavage analysis of copy DNA from 11 index absorptive hypercalciuric patients .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "On the basis of these results , we propose that the enhanced intestinal calcium absorption invariably seen in absorptive hypercalciuria and attendant symptoms of this disorder are not attributable to mutations of the <extra_id_0> VDR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> and are not linked to a common <extra_id_0> VDR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> genotype .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
