{"text": "In the present study , we have investigated the effect of glucocorticoid hormones on neutrophil - mediated tumor cell cytostasis and found that hydrocortisone and a synthetic hormone , dexamethasone ( Dex ) , inhibited cytostasis in the presence or absence of <extra_id_0> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The effect of Dex was completely reversed by a <extra_id_0> glucocorticoid receptor <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> antagonist , RU38486 .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "To clarify the underlying mechanisms , we examined effects of Dex on the binding avidity of <extra_id_0> beta2 integrin <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> on the neutrophil surface and how these might in turn affect neutrophil-to-tumor cell binding .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Dex was found to inhibit these neutrophil properties , and RU38486 completely suppressed both forms of Dex inhibition .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Taken together , our findings suggest that glucocorticoid hormone inhibition of neutrophil - mediated tumor cell cytostasis is at least partially due to a lowering of the ligand binding avidity of <extra_id_0> beta2 integrin <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> on the neutrophil surface .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
