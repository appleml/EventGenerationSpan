{"text": "To identify the requisite bacterial ligands , studies with isogenic mutants of P . aeruginosa PAK lacking pili , flagella , and the <extra_id_0> RpoN sigma factor <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> were undertaken .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The RpoN mutant , lacking pili , flagella , and nonpilus adhesins , bound poorly and was resistant to ingestion by both macrophages and neutrophils .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Pili were not absolutely required for binding or phagocytosis of P . aeruginosa .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The presence of a flagellum was not required for binding of P . aeruginosa to macrophages but was critical for the subsequent internalization of the bacterium , suggesting that this factor or a surface ligand associated with its assembly was responsible for stimulation of nonopsonic phagocytosis .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
