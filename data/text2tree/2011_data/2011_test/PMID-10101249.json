{"text": "Allelic variation at the 3'-end of the <extra_id_0> vitamin D receptor <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> ( <extra_id_0> VDR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> ) gene has been associated with a 3-5-fold increased risk of developing prostate cancer and with differences in bone mineralization .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "This genetic diversity does not alter the <extra_id_0> VDR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> protein structurally , but instead may be a marker ( s ) of other , nearby polymorphisms that influence message stability or translation .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The work reported here was instigated to identify additional <extra_id_0> VDR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> 3'-UTR polymorphisms that may have functional significance and to then test whether these genetic variants alter message stability .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Initially , four novel , frequently occurring sequence variants were identified that associated with two common haplotypes that were described previously .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "These common sequence variants were not found within three message-destabilizing elements that we mapped within the 3'-UTR of the <extra_id_0> vitamin D receptor <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> mRNA .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Furthermore , the two <extra_id_0> VDR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> 3'-UTR haplotypes conferred an identical half-life on a heterologous beta-globin reporter gene , in an in vitro assay .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "We therefore conclude that common polymorphisms within the <extra_id_0> VDR <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> 3'-UTR do not influence message stability .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
