{"text": "It is generally assumed that most mammalian genes are transcribed from both alleles .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Hence , the diploid state of the genome offers the advantage that a loss - of-function mutation in one allele can be compensated for by the remaining wild-type allele of the same gene .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Indeed , the vast majority of human disease syndromes and engineered mutations in the mouse genome are recessive , indicating that recessiveness is the 'default ' state .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "However , a minority of genes are semi-dominant , as heterozygous loss - of-function mutation in these genes leads to phenotypic abnormalities .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "This condition , known as haploinsufficiency , has been described for five of the nine mammalian Pax genes , which are associated with mouse developmental mutants and human disease syndromes .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Recently we have reported that the <extra_id_0> Pax5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> gene is subject to allele - specific regulation during B cell development .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "<extra_id_0> Pax5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> is predominantly transcribed from only one of its two alleles in early B-lymphoid progenitors and mature B cells , while it transiently switches to a biallelic mode of transcription in pre-B and immature B cells .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "As a consequence , B-lymphoid tissues are mosaic with regard to the transcribed allele , and heterozygous mutation of <extra_id_0> Pax5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> therefore results in deletion of B lymphocytes expressing only the mutant allele .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The allele - specific regulation of <extra_id_0> Pax5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> raises the intriguing possibility that monoallelic expression may also be the mechanism causing the haploinsufficiency of other Pax genes .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In this review , we discuss different models accounting for the haploinsufficiency of mammalian Pax genes , provide further evidence in support of the allele - specific regulation of <extra_id_0> Pax5 <extra_id_2> Protein <extra_id_1> and discuss the implication of these findings in the context of the recent literature describing the stochastic and monoallelic activation of other hematopoietic genes .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
