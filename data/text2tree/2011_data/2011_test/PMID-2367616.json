{"text": "Some patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) have elevated plasma cortisol concentrations and show failure to suppress cortisol secretion upon administration of dexamethasone ( DEX ) , yet they do not have Cushingoid features .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "To study whether this represents glucocorticoid ( GC ) resistance , [ 3H ] - DEX-binding assays were used to measure , in vitro , the GC receptor affinity ( 1 / Kd ) and number ( Bmax ) in mononuclear leukocytes of 11 MDD patients and 15 control subjects .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "No receptor abnormalities were detected in the MDD group ; thus any cellular defect leading to a lack of responsiveness to GC in the MDD patients , if present , probably lies beyond the initial receptor binding .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "DEX ( 1.0 mg orally ) was administered to study in vivo GC receptor down-regulation .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Compared to the control group , fewer depressed subjects down-regulated Bmax after DEX .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "These results do not lend support to previous reports suggesting that GC resistance in MDD results from a GC receptor - binding abnormality , and they emphasize the importance of considering receptor studies in the context of GC - mediated cell processes in order to identify the exact cellular defect ( s ) leading to GC resistance .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_1>"}
