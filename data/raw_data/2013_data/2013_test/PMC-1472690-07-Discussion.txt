Animal models of sepsis and myocardial injury suggest that a beta-1 to 3-D-glucan like GP mediates its protective mechanisms, in part, via a rapid shift from NFkappaB- to PI3K-signaling [22,37].

Our study provides novel evidence that downstream of recognition and signaling pro-inflammatory transcription factor binding and cytokine expression of human leukocytes is switched to an anti-inflammatory phenotype by GP.

We confirmed and extended previous results [13-16] indicating that, in the absence of other stimuli, beta-1 to 3-D-glucans induced binding of NFkappaB-, NFIL-6- and NFAT-mers to cytokine promoters.
# T1 Protein S3 153 159 570 576 NFIL-6
# T2 Protein S3 165 169 582 586 NFAT

Because of the multiple band shifts observed for NFAT binding (Fig. 1A), one could speculate that there is activation of several different NFAT isoforms, probably derived from alternative splicing [38].
# T3 Protein S4 49 53 664 668 NFAT
# T4 Protein S4 139 143 754 758 NFAT

Interestingly, the GP-induced transcription factor binding transformed only into a very limited cytokine response, namely IL-8 and IL-1RA (Fig. 3B).
# T5 Protein S5 122 126 940 944 IL-8
# T6 Protein S5 131 137 949 955 IL-1RA

Hence, our data are in aggreement with the few reports describing a beta-1 to 3-D-glucan-mediated IL-8 [6,16,19] and IL-1RA production [17].
# T7 Protein S6 98 102 1065 1069 IL-8
# T8 Protein S6 117 123 1084 1090 IL-1RA

In addition, our EMSA/supershift and immunoblotting results demonstrated a GP-mediated predominant binding of NFkappaB p65 and to a lesser extent of p50 to a kappaB consensus site of the IL-8 promoter (Figs. 1A, 2).
# T9 Protein S7 119 122 1227 1230 p65
# T10 Protein S7 149 152 1257 1260 p50
# T11 Protein S7 187 191 1295 1299 IL-8

Results by Schulte and colleagues [28] pointed to an induction of IL-8 transcription depending on activation via an NFkappaB p65/65 homodimer, rather than via p65/50 heterodimers, which might be the case for the GP-mediated IL-8 transcription.
# T12 Protein S8 66 70 1390 1394 IL-8
# T13 Protein S8 125 128 1449 1452 p65

# T16 Protein S8 163 165 1487 1489 50
# T17 Protein S8 224 228 1548 1552 IL-8

A GP-mediated IL-8 transcription based upon a cooperation between transactivated NFkappaB p65 and NFIL-6 [13,39] or NFATc2 dimer binding to the IL-8kappaB site [38] seems also possible.
# T18 Protein S9 14 18 1582 1586 IL-8
# T19 Protein S9 90 93 1658 1661 p65
# T20 Protein S9 98 104 1666 1672 NFIL-6
# T21 Protein S9 116 122 1684 1690 NFATc2
# T22 Protein S9 144 148 1712 1716 IL-8

The IL-8kappaB consensus site exhibits a preferentially p65 binding half site and thus differs from the kappaB half site described for TNFalpha and IL-1beta [27,40], supporting the idea of regulating NFkappaB binding through combinatorial associations of the subunits and the specific sequence of the decameric kappaB motif [41,42].
# T23 Protein S10 4 8 1758 1762 IL-8
# T24 Protein S10 56 59 1810 1813 p65
# T25 Protein S10 135 143 1889 1897 TNFalpha
# T26 Protein S10 148 156 1902 1910 IL-1beta

Unlike LPS or TSST-1, we found that GP did not induce IL-1beta, but it strongly induced IL-1RA, suggesting an immediate anti-inflammatory potential of GP.
# T27 Protein S11 14 20 2101 2107 TSST-1
# T28 Protein S11 54 62 2141 2149 IL-1beta
# T29 Protein S11 88 94 2175 2181 IL-1RA

Analysing the IL-1RA promoter [34], we discovered four new binding sites (Fig. 8): an NFkappaB3 site (between -100 and -130), an NFkappaB consensus site (-266 and -280), another NFkappaB2/3 site (-288 and -302) and a more distal NFATP2/3 site (-471 and -490).
# T30 Protein S12 14 20 2256 2262 IL-1RA

Our data indicated that GP leads to production of IL-1RA primarily via induction of NFATP2/3 and NFIL-6 DNA binding, which might be due to differences in the binding motif or the composition of the activated transcription factors (NFAT) between the IFNgamma, IL-6 and IL-1RA promoter.
# T31 Protein S13 84 90 2586 2592 NFATP2
# T32 Protein S13 91 92 2593 2594 3
# T33 Protein S13 97 103 2599 2605 NFIL-6

# T36 Protein S13 259 263 2761 2765 IL-6
# T37 Protein S13 268 274 2770 2776 IL-1RA

The differential decrease of NFkappaB, NFAT and NFIL-6 binding to sites in the IL-1RA promoter as well as of IL-1RA mRNA and protein induced by selective inhibitors prior to GP treatment might suggest that these steps are linked to each other and necessary for induction of IL-1RA (Fig. 7).

# T42 Protein S14 274 280 3061 3067 IL-1RA

Regarding cellular sources, both, monocytes as well as neutrophils have been reported to produce IL-1RA [32].
# T43 Protein S15 97 103 3175 3181 IL-1RA

Flow cytometric experiments seemed to confirm that monocytes and neutrophils were able to produce IL-8 just as IL-1RA in response to GP (data not shown).
# T44 Protein S16 98 102 3286 3290 IL-8
# T45 Protein S16 111 117 3299 3305 IL-1RA

This GP-induced cytokine profile was substantially more restricted than that of LPS or TSST-1, which is likely due to differences in recognition and signaling between LPS, TSST-1 and GP.
# T46 Protein S17 87 93 3429 3435 TSST-1
# T47 Protein S17 172 178 3514 3520 TSST-1

Recognition of LPS is mainly mediated through Toll-like receptor 4 and subsequent signaling via the NFkappaB pathway, leading to expression of pro-inflammatory mediators like TNFalpha [43].
# T48 Protein S18 46 66 3575 3595 Toll-like receptor 4
# T49 Protein S18 175 183 3704 3712 TNFalpha

A bacterial superantigen like TSST-1 acts through binding to MHC-II molecules and subsequently the T cell receptor, leading to release of mainly IFNgamma and TNFalpha, the latter via both, PI3K and p38 mitogen-activated kinase signaling [44,45].
# T50 Protein S19 30 36 3749 3755 TSST-1
# T51 Protein S19 145 153 3864 3872 IFNgamma
# T52 Protein S19 158 166 3877 3885 TNFalpha
# T53 Protein S19 198 226 3917 3945 p38 mitogen-activated kinase

Altogether, the induction of the neutrophil-attracting IL-8 and the anti-inflammatory IL-1RA by fungal carbohydrates (GP) may well fit to a benign PAMP response, mounting defensive mechanisms against a possible microbial attack.
# T54 Protein S20 55 59 4020 4024 IL-8
# T55 Protein S20 86 92 4051 4057 IL-1RA

Potentially even more relevant than the specific cytokine panel induced by GP, we found that, in the presence of other stimuli (LPS or TSST-1), GP ameliorated their pro-inflammatory immune reactions, similar to the effects in murine models of sepsis and inflammation [21-24].
# T56 Protein S21 135 141 4329 4335 TSST-1

Mainly, GP altered the TSST-1-induced IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio from a pro- to an anti-inflammatory profile via down-regulation of IL-1beta and IL-6, at the same time there was a synergistic up-regulation of IL-1RA.
# T57 Protein S22 23 29 4493 4499 TSST-1
# T58 Protein S22 38 46 4508 4516 IL-1beta
# T59 Protein S22 47 53 4517 4523 IL-1RA
# T60 Protein S22 127 135 4597 4605 IL-1beta
# T61 Protein S22 140 144 4610 4614 IL-6
# T62 Protein S22 204 210 4674 4680 IL-1RA

In part, this change may be caused by GP-mediated modulations of the TSST-1 induced binding of NFkappaB, NFIL-6 and NFAT to known and up to now unknown sites within the IL-8 and IL-1RA promoter instead of the TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 or IFNgamma promoter.

# T64 Protein S23 105 111 4787 4793 NFIL-6

# T66 Protein S23 169 173 4851 4855 IL-8

# T71 Protein S23 237 245 4919 4927 IFNgamma

Accordingly, we found that the TSST-1-induced binding of NFkappaB to sites from the TNFalpha promoter negatively correlated with the GP-mediated enhancement of the TSST-1-induced IL-1RA production (r = -0.88; p < 0.01; data not shown in detail).
# T72 Protein S24 31 37 4969 4975 TSST-1
# T73 Protein S24 84 92 5022 5030 TNFalpha
# T74 Protein S24 164 170 5102 5108 TSST-1
# T75 Protein S24 179 185 5117 5123 IL-1RA

Of the four examined NFkappaB sites from the IL-1RA promoter, mostly the TSST-1- and LPS-induced binding to the NFkappaB3 and the TSST-1-induced binding to the new NFkappaB consensus site seemed to be increased by GP.
# T76 Protein S25 45 51 5229 5235 IL-1RA
# T77 Protein S25 73 79 5257 5263 TSST-1
# T78 Protein S25 130 136 5314 5320 TSST-1

So, while we observed a GP-mediated down-regulation of the LPS- and the TSST-1-induced NFkappaB binding to sites of the TNFalpha promoter, there was an up-regulation to NFkappaB3 and NFkappaB consensus sites of the IL-1RA promoter.
# T79 Protein S26 72 78 5474 5480 TSST-1
# T80 Protein S26 120 128 5522 5530 TNFalpha
# T81 Protein S26 215 221 5617 5623 IL-1RA

These seemingly contradictory data could be explained by differences in either NFkappaB subunits or conserved nucleotides (#1, 2, 3, 10) within the decameric NFkappaB binding motif between the TNFalpha and the IL-1RA promoter (for NFkappaB3 the IL-1RA motif contains a T on position 10 instead of the conserved C in the TNFalpha motif, see Table 1), probably leading to differences in binding [41,42].
# T82 Protein S27 193 201 5827 5835 TNFalpha
# T83 Protein S27 210 216 5844 5850 IL-1RA

Despite the location of the new NFkappaB consensus site (-266 and -280) in the inhibitory element (-250 and -294) of the IL-1RA promoter [30], we observed no inhibition.
# T84 Protein S28 121 127 6157 6163 IL-1RA

On the other side, we found an inhibitory NFkappaB2/3 site (-288 and -302) towards the end of the inhibitory element, demonstrating down-regulations of the LPS- and TSST-1-induced binding, which could not be altered by GP.
# T85 Protein S29 165 171 6371 6377 TSST-1

In our opinion, this site may therefore represent at least a part of the previoulsy described inhibitory element [30].

The GP-modulated increase in TSST-1-induced binding to the new NFkappaB3 and NFkappaB consensus site, the NFIL-6 site [32] as well as to the novel NFATP2/3 site may explain the synergistic up-regulation of the TSST-1-induced IL-1RA production.
# T86 Protein S31 29 35 6577 6583 TSST-1
# T87 Protein S31 210 216 6758 6764 TSST-1
# T88 Protein S31 225 231 6773 6779 IL-1RA

We think that this GP-modulated activation of transcription was reflected by the decrease of the IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio following GP + TSST-1 (Fig. 6).
# T89 Protein S32 97 105 6889 6897 IL-1beta
# T90 Protein S32 106 112 6898 6904 IL-1RA
# T91 Protein S32 134 140 6926 6932 TSST-1

In this context, it has been postulated that in vitro a 100fold excess of IL-1RA over IL-1beta might control the biological effects of IL-1 [46,47].
# T92 Protein S33 74 80 7017 7023 IL-1RA
# T93 Protein S33 86 94 7029 7037 IL-1beta
# T94 Protein S33 135 139 7078 7082 IL-1

Since, in fact, the IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio following GP + TSST-1 is partially less than 0.01, it is not unreasonable to assume that IL-1beta bioactivity is inactivated in our system.
# T95 Protein S34 20 28 7112 7120 IL-1beta
# T96 Protein S34 29 35 7121 7127 IL-1RA
# T97 Protein S34 57 63 7149 7155 TSST-1
# T98 Protein S34 131 139 7223 7231 IL-1beta

Indeed, GP reduced the TSST-1-induced, IL-1-dependent IL-2 production of murine EL-4 cells (data not shown in detail).
# T99 Protein S35 23 29 7297 7303 TSST-1
# T100 Protein S35 39 43 7313 7317 IL-1
# T101 Protein S35 54 58 7328 7332 IL-2

The weaker modulating effects of GP on the LPS-induced immune response observed in this study, may be attributed to delicately balanced differences in signaling pathways between LPS and TSST-1 [43-45].
# T102 Protein S36 186 192 7579 7585 TSST-1

TSST-1 has been shown to use the PI3K pathway for signaling [44] and this effect may be sustained by GP treatment [22,37].
# T103 Protein S37 0 6 7595 7601 TSST-1

It has been demonstrated that in septic/LPS-adapted leukocytes the PI3K pathway selectively controls sIL-1RA but not IL-1beta production [48].
# T104 Protein S38 102 108 7820 7826 IL-1RA
# T105 Protein S38 117 125 7835 7843 IL-1beta

Signaling via PI3K has been reported to be involved in the activation of NFAT in T cells [49].
# T106 Protein S39 73 77 7934 7938 NFAT

Activation of NFkappaB can also take place via PI3K [50], which may offer an explanation for a difference in signaling between GP (PI3K) and LPS (mitogen-activated kinase signaling).

This idea may be supported by another study showing that despite the use of similar PRR, LPS and peptidoglycan activated the IL-1RA gene through different mechanisms/DNA-binding proteins and acted synergistically in combination, suggestive of signals which are not equivalent in all parts [51].
