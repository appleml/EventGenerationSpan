Activated p53 mediates apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, senescence, DNA repair, or metabolism (Lane and Levine, 2010).
# T1 Protein S1 10 13 10 13 p53

The primary structures of p53 and its isoforms are depicted (Figure 2).
# T2 Protein S2 26 29 142 145 p53

p53 induces cell cycle arrest by transactivating genes such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, or microRNA miR34.
# T3 Protein S3 0 3 188 191 p53
# T4 Protein S3 97 100 285 288 p21
# T5 Protein S3 114 119 302 307 miR34

p53 induces apoptosis by transactivating proapoptotic genes such as BAX, PUMA, SCOTIN, and FAS, and inhibiting the antiapoptotic gene BCL-2 (Lane and Levine, 2010).
# T6 Protein S4 0 3 309 312 p53
# T7 Protein S4 68 71 377 380 BAX
# T8 Protein S4 73 77 382 386 PUMA
# T9 Protein S4 79 85 388 394 SCOTIN
# T10 Protein S4 91 94 400 403 FAS
# T11 Protein S4 134 139 443 448 BCL-2

p53 triggers pro-survival or cell death response, depending upon cell types, the intensity of the stress signal, and the extent of cellular damage (Menendez et al., 2009).
# T12 Protein S5 0 3 474 477 p53

Also, p53 plays a role in controlling cell motility via regulating the expression of smooth muscle alpha-actin (Comer et al., 1998), collagens IIalpha1 and VIalpha1 (Sun et al., 1999), and many others.

# T14 Protein S6 85 110 731 756 smooth muscle alpha-actin
# T15 Protein S6 133 151 779 797 collagens IIalpha1
# T16 Protein S6 156 164 802 810 VIalpha1
