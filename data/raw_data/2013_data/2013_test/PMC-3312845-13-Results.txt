Effect of sTNFp55R infusion on SE-induced serum-protein extravasation and neuronal damage
# T1 Protein S1 11 18 11 18 TNFp55R

In our previous [5,7,8,20] and preliminary data, vasogenic edema and neuronal damage were noticeable at 1 day and 3 days after SE, respectively.

Therefore, we determined that 3 days after SE was the best time point to evaluate the effect of sTNFp55R infusion on both vasogenic edema and neuronal damages induced by SE.

In saline-treated animals, the PC was stained diffusely with anti-rat IgG (Figure 2A).

The volume of vasogenic edema was 17.1 +/- 1.5 mm3 (Figure 2E).

The number of FJB-positive neurons in the PC was 236,145 +/- 49,469 (Figure 2B).

In sTNFp55R-treated animals, SE-induced vasogenic edema was attenuated to 9.8 +/- 0.7 mm3 (Figures 2C and 2E).

In addition, the number of FJB-positive neurons in the PC was 89,138 +/- 5,698 (Figures 2D-E).

Thus, sTNFp55R infusion attenuated SE-induced vasogenic edema and neuronal damage compared to saline-infused animals (p < 0.05).
