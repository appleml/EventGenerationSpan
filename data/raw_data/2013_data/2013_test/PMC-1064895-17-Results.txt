Activation of PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway on IL-17 production by anti-CD3
# T1 Protein S1 19 22 19 22 Akt
# T2 Protein S1 54 59 54 59 IL-17

To determine downstream effector molecules of the PI3K pathway, we evaluated the activation of Akt by western blotting.
# T3 Protein S2 95 98 178 181 Akt

As shown in Fig. 6, at 10 min of incubation with anti-CD3 (10 mug/ml) or LY294002 (20 muM), no difference in the amounts of phosphorylated Akt was observed.
# T4 Protein S3 139 142 342 345 Akt

However, after 30 min of incubation, phosphorylated Akt increased (lane 2), and the effect of inhibition by LY294002 (lane 3) reached a peak at 60 min, lasting to 120-240 min.
# T5 Protein S4 52 55 412 415 Akt

In contrast, non-phosphorylated Akt and beta-actin remained unchanged regardless of incubation time.
# T6 Protein S5 32 35 568 571 Akt
# T7 Protein S5 40 50 576 586 beta-actin

PHA, concanavalin A and IL-15 also demonstrated the same effect on phosphorylated Akt as shown with anti-CD3, which was an inhibition by wortmannin and PDTC as well as by LY294002 (data not shown).
# T8 Protein S6 0 3 637 640 PHA
# T9 Protein S6 24 29 661 666 IL-15
# T10 Protein S6 82 85 719 722 Akt
