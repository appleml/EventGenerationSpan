Model of RIP1, Akt and JNK Dependent Signaling in Necroptotic L929 Cells
# T1 Protein S1 9 13 9 13 RIP1

In this study we investigated RIP1 kinase-dependent signaling pathways using mouse fibrosarcoma L929 cells that die by necroptosis when treated with the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk.
# T2 Protein S2 30 34 103 107 RIP1

Altogether, our results suggest that Akt kinase is specifically engaged in signaling downstream from RIP1 kinase, which leads to a selective increase in its phosphorylation on Thr308, but not Ser473.
# T3 Protein S3 101 105 359 363 RIP1

According to our model (Fig. 9), necroptosis-associated phosphorylation of Akt requires two distinct signals.

The first input, which is induced by growth factors, leads to the plasma membrane localization of Akt.

Expression of a constitutively membrane-targeted Akt construct, Myr-Akt, overcomes the requirement for growth factors.
# T4 Protein S6 64 71 735 742 Myr-Akt

At the same time, expression of Myr-Akt alone is not sufficient for the induction of necroptosis.
# T5 Protein S7 32 39 822 829 Myr-Akt

A second, RIP1 kinase-dependent input is required for Thr308 phosphorylation of Akt in response to caspase inhibition and is essential for the propagation of the necroptotic signal.
# T6 Protein S8 10 14 898 902 RIP1

Using Akt inhibitors, knockdown of Akt isoforms, and the expression of Akt mutants, we showed that necroptotic activation of Akt is indispensable for this form of cell death in L929 cells.

We also investigated downstream Akt-dependent pathways that contribute to necroptosis.

First, we demonstrated that selective necroptotic phosphorylation of Thr308 of Akt is sufficient to increase its activity towards a number of known substrates and Akt effector pathways such as the mTORC1 pathway, which, in turn, contributes to cell death.

Second, our data suggested that Akt activation provides a pivotal link connecting RIP1 kinase to known downstream signaling and execution events in necroptotic L929 cells, namely, JNK activation and autocrine TNFalpha synthesis, a critical event in necroptosis in L929 cells [15].
# T7 Protein S12 82 86 1684 1688 RIP1
# T8 Protein S12 209 217 1811 1819 TNFalpha

In order to further test our model, we examined Akt phosphorylation after inhibition of a downstream kinase in the pathway, JNK.

However, we found that SP600125, which protected L929 cells from death and inhibited TNFalpha production (Fig. 2A,B S2A S10A), inhibited both basal and post-treatment phosphorylation levels of Akt at both Ser473 and Thr308 (Fig.
# T9 Protein S14 85 93 2097 2105 TNFalpha

S10B).

It has been published that SP600125 is a somewhat non-specific inhibitor that may inhibit the p110delta subunit of PI3K [41] and PDK1 [42].
# T10 Protein S16 94 111 2342 2359 p110delta subunit
# T11 Protein S16 129 133 2377 2381 PDK1

Both of these off-target effects could inhibit basal Akt phosphorylation levels, precluding the use of SP600125 in this system.

Therefore, to examine the role of JNK, we switched to a more specific JNK inhibitor, JNK inhibitor VIII [43], and siRNAs against JNK1 and JNK2 (Fig.
# T12 Protein S18 129 133 2645 2649 JNK1
# T13 Protein S18 138 142 2654 2658 JNK2

S10B-G).

As expected, specific inhibition or knockdown of JNK1/2 allowed phosphorylation of Akt on Thr308 while inhibiting the phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser63 (Fig.
# T14 Protein S20 49 53 2723 2727 JNK1
# T15 Protein S20 54 55 2728 2729 2
# T16 Protein S20 137 142 2811 2816 c-Jun

S10B,E), agreeing with our model.

It did not, however, lead to a reduction in TNFalpha production or cell death (Fig.
# T17 Protein S22 44 52 2910 2918 TNFalpha

S10C,D,F,G), suggesting that earlier data with SP600125 protection (Fig. 2) could reflect off-target effects of this molecule, rather than JNK inhibition.

Previous reports also suggested a critical role for c-Jun in necroptosis and autocrine TNFalpha synthesis [13], [14], [15] and we confirmed these conclusions using c-Jun siRNA knockdown (Fig.
# T18 Protein S24 52 57 3157 3162 c-Jun
# T19 Protein S24 87 95 3192 3200 TNFalpha
# T20 Protein S24 164 169 3269 3274 c-Jun

S10H-J).

Notably, in this case, Thr308 phosphorylation was reduced after the induction of necroptosis.

Thus, autocrine TNFalpha production, dependent on c-Jun, may create a feedback loop that contributes to the delayed activation of Akt.
# T21 Protein S27 16 24 3416 3424 TNFalpha
# T22 Protein S27 50 55 3450 3455 c-Jun

It is also important to note that we observed an overall increase in the protein level of c-Jun after treatment of L929 cells with zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha, which was both Akt and mTOR-dependent (Fig. 6E,F).
# T23 Protein S28 90 95 3625 3630 c-Jun
# T24 Protein S28 143 151 3678 3686 TNFalpha

These new data led us to an unexpected, but important conclusion that c-Jun is critical for necroptosis, while JNK activity may serve as a useful marker of pathway activation, but may be either redundant (e.g. phosphorylation of c-Jun on a site other than Ser63 may occur [44]) or dispensable functionally.
# T25 Protein S29 70 75 3809 3814 c-Jun
# T26 Protein S29 229 234 3968 3973 c-Jun

In addition, researchers need to use caution when using SP600125 due to potantial off-target effects.
