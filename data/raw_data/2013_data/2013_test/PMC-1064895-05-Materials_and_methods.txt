CD4+ T-cell isolation by MACS
# T1 Protein S1 0 3 0 3 CD4

Anti-CD4 microbeads were used essentially as recommended by the manufacturer (Miltenyi) [19].
# T2 Protein S2 5 8 35 38 CD4

PBMC were resuspended in 80 mul of FBS staining buffer.

Anti-CD4 microbeads (20 mul) were added and incubated for 15 min at 6-12degreesC.
# T3 Protein S4 5 8 185 188 CD4

Saturating amounts of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies were added for a further 10 min.

Cells were diluted in 2.5 ml of FBS staining buffer, pelleted, resuspended in 500 mul and magnetically separated, usually on an AutoMACS magnet fitted with a MACS MS column.

Flow-through and two 1 ml washes were collected as the negative fraction.

Enriched cells were collected in two 0.5 ml aliquots from the column after removal from the magnet.

Alternatively, cells stained with anti-CD4-phycoerythrin were washed, magnetically labeled with anti-phycoerythrin microbeads (20 mul added to 80 mul of cell suspension; 15 min, 6-12degreesC), and magnetically separated as described above.
# T4 Protein S9 39 42 739 742 CD4

The purity of cells was assessed by flow cytometric analysis of stained cells on a FACS Vantage sorter.

Most (more than 97%) of the isolated cells had the CD4 T cell marker.
# T5 Protein S11 51 54 1095 1098 CD4
