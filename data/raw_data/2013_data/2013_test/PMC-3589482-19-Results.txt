To investigate the importance of C/EBP-beta to endogenous SerpinB2 mRNA expression in response to LPS, we utilized C/EBP-beta-null (Cebpb-/-) and wild-type MEFs (Cebpb+/+), since RAW264.7 cells constitutively express endogenous C/EBP-beta.

# T4 Protein S2 58 66 182 190 SerpinB2
# T5 Protein S2 115 125 239 249 C/EBP-beta
# T6 Protein S2 132 137 256 261 Cebpb
# T7 Protein S2 162 167 286 291 Cebpb
# T8 Protein S2 228 238 352 362 C/EBP-beta

Wild-type MEFs express low levels of endogenous SerpinB2 and the absence of C/EBP-beta attenuated endogenous SerpinB2 mRNA expression.

# T10 Protein S3 76 86 440 450 C/EBP-beta
# T11 Protein S3 109 117 473 481 SerpinB2

LPS stimulated an increase in SerpinB2 mRNA expression in wild-type MEFs (Fig. 6A), whereas LPS-stimulated SerpinB2 mRNA expression was significantly dampened in Cebpb-/- MEFs as compared to wild-type.

# T14 Protein S4 162 167 661 666 Cebpb

We next tested if similar effects could be seen in thioglycollate-elicited inflammatory macrophages in which C/EBP-beta expression was knocked down using species-specific lentiviral shRNAs (Fig. 6B, left).
# T15 Protein S5 109 119 810 820 C/EBP-beta

As was observed in MEFs, both constitutive and LPS-induced SerpinB2 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in C/EBP-beta-deficient inflammatory macrophages (Fig. 6B, right).
# T16 Protein S6 59 67 966 974 SerpinB2
# T17 Protein S6 115 125 1022 1032 C/EBP-beta

These data show that C/EBP-beta is critical for mediating constitutive and LPS-inducible transcription of endogenous SerpinB2 mRNA.
