Induction of Apoptotic Cell Death and Inhibition of the Expression of Anti-apoptotic Proteins in CCR5-/- Mice
# T1 Protein S1 97 101 97 101 CCR5

To see whether inhibition of NF-kappaB activity results in the induction of apoptotic cell death and expression of NF-kappaB target apoptotic cell death regulatory protein, the levels of apoptotic cell death and expression of apoptotic cell death regulatory proteins were assessed.

Apoptotic cell death in the tumor sections were evaluated in the CCR5+/+ and CCR5-/- mice that were inoculated with melanoma cells.
# T2 Protein S3 65 69 457 461 CCR5
# T3 Protein S3 77 81 469 473 CCR5

TUNEL staining revealed a higher frequency of apoptotic cell death in the tumor tissues of the CCR5-/- mice than that of the CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 3A).
# T4 Protein S4 95 99 619 623 CCR5
# T5 Protein S4 125 129 649 653 CCR5

Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence showed that high levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax were found more frequently in the CCR5-/- mice than in the CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 3B and 3C).
# T6 Protein S5 130 134 805 809 CCR5
# T7 Protein S5 155 159 830 834 CCR5

Consistent with the immunohistochemical data, Western blot analysis of tumor proteins showed greater increased levels of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved PARP and Bax, whereas the levels of Bcl-2 and C-IAP1 were significantly decreased in CCR5-/- mice tissues (Figure 3D).
# T8 Protein S6 213 219 1076 1082 C-IAP1
# T9 Protein S6 252 256 1115 1119 CCR5
