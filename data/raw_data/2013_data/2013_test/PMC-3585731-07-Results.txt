Akt and mTORC1 Control the Activation of JNK during Necroptosis

JNK is a well-established regulator of TNFalpha synthesis in a variety of systems [13], [14], [15], [34].
# T1 Protein S2 39 47 103 111 TNFalpha

Therefore, the ability of Akt and mTORC1 inhibitors to block the increase in TNFalpha mRNA lead us to examine their role in the activation of JNK during necroptosis.
# T2 Protein S3 77 85 247 255 TNFalpha

Knockdown of Akt isoforms Akt1 and Akt2 or inhibition of Akt prominently suppressed the necroptosis dependent increase in JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 6E, S6D,E) suggesting that Akt may provide a link between RIP1 and JNK activation.
# T3 Protein S4 26 30 362 366 Akt1
# T4 Protein S4 35 39 371 375 Akt2
# T5 Protein S4 130 135 466 471 c-Jun
# T6 Protein S4 216 220 552 556 RIP1

Importantly, inhibition of Akt only inhibited the delayed, but not the early, increase in bFGF/zVAD.fmk induced JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig.
# T7 Protein S5 90 94 667 671 bFGF
# T8 Protein S5 120 125 697 702 c-Jun

S6F).

Knockdown of mTOR, rapamycin and the p70S6K inhibitor PF-4708671 also attenuated the necroptosis-associated increase in JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 6F, S6E,G, Fig.
# T9 Protein S7 37 43 768 774 p70S6K
# T10 Protein S7 128 133 859 864 c-Jun

S5D).

Overall, these data suggested that the Akt-mTORC1-S6K axis, acting downstream from RIP1 kinase, is required for the increase in JNK activity during necroptosis in L929 cells.
