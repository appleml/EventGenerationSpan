CD4+ T cells orchestrate the Th1-type cell-mediated immune response in RA [22].
# T1 Protein S1 0 3 0 3 CD4

Activated CD4+ T cells stimulate macrophages, synovial fibroblasts, B cells, and osteoclasts through the expression of cell surface molecules and Th1 cytokines, thereby contributing to both the chronic inflammation and the joint destruction.
# T2 Protein S2 10 13 90 93 CD4

CD4+ T cells require two signals to be activated; antigen receptor occupancy and CD28-mediated costimulation.
# T3 Protein S3 0 3 322 325 CD4
# T4 Protein S3 81 85 403 407 CD28

In the ST lesion, the CD28 ligands, both CD80 and CD86, together with MHC class II antigens, are substantially expressed by antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells [18-20].
# T5 Protein S4 22 26 454 458 CD28
# T6 Protein S4 41 45 473 477 CD80
# T7 Protein S4 50 54 482 486 CD86

The significance of CD28 engagement in the T-cell-mediated disease process has recently been proven by the clinical efficacy of its blocker cytotoxic T-cell-associated antigen 4 (CD152)-IgG in RA patients [23].
# T8 Protein S5 20 24 650 654 CD28
# T9 Protein S5 140 189 770 819 cytotoxic T-cell-associated antigen 4 (CD152)-IgG

IL-10 plays a predominant role in limiting immune and inflammatory responses by regulating the function of both macrophages and Th1 cells [1].
# T10 Protein S6 0 5 841 846 IL-10

IL-10 inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD28 molecule and the subsequent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase binding in T cells, and thereby directly acts on T cells [24].
# T11 Protein S7 0 5 984 989 IL-10
# T12 Protein S7 51 55 1035 1039 CD28

In the present study, we found that PB CD4+ T cells from patients with active RA, in the presence of IL-10, are able to produce higher levels of IFN-gamma after CD3 and CD28 costimulation than normal CD4+ T cells.
# T13 Protein S8 39 42 1200 1203 CD4

# T16 Protein S8 169 173 1330 1334 CD28
# T17 Protein S8 200 203 1361 1364 CD4

Despite high-level IL-10R1 expression and constitutive STAT3 activation, IL-10-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is suppressed in RA CD4+ T cells, in contrast to normal CD4+ T cells, where STAT3 phosphorylation is dose-dependently inducible by IL-10.
# T18 Protein S9 19 26 1394 1401 IL-10R1
# T19 Protein S9 55 60 1430 1435 STAT3

# T25 Protein S9 252 257 1627 1632 IL-10

Serum IL-6 from RA patients induces STAT3 but not STAT1 phosphorylation in normal CD4+ T cells, and exogenous IL-6 induces the resistance to IL-10 inhibition of IFN-gamma production.
# T26 Protein S10 6 10 1640 1644 IL-6

# T32 Protein S10 161 170 1795 1804 IFN-gamma

RA CD4+ T cells contain higher levels of SOCS1 but contain lower levels of SOCS3 transcripts in comparison with normal CD4+ T cells.
# T33 Protein S11 3 6 1820 1823 CD4
# T34 Protein S11 41 46 1858 1863 SOCS1
# T35 Protein S11 75 80 1892 1897 SOCS3
# T36 Protein S11 119 122 1936 1939 CD4

These findings indicate that CD4+ T cells become resistant to the inhibitory effect of IL-10 before migration into the inflamed ST, and suggest that this resistance may be attributable to impaired IL-10-dependent STAT3 activation, in association with sustained STAT3 phosphorylation and SOCS1 induction.
# T37 Protein S12 29 32 1979 1982 CD4

# T42 Protein S12 287 292 2237 2242 SOCS1

IL-10-mediated inhibition of CD4+ T-cell cytokine production is principally dependent on its inhibition of macrophage antigen-presenting cell function [1].
# T43 Protein S13 0 5 2254 2259 IL-10
# T44 Protein S13 29 32 2283 2286 CD4

However, this indirect inhibitory effect is thought to be restricted at the site of T-cell activation in RA, because macrophages in the ST express high levels of cytokines, CD80 and CD86 molecules, and MHC class II antigens [10,18-20].
# T45 Protein S14 173 177 2583 2587 CD80
# T46 Protein S14 182 186 2592 2596 CD86

More recently, IL-10 has been shown to induce the antigen-specific T-cell unresponsiveness by inhibiting CD28 tyrosine phosphorylation [33].
# T47 Protein S15 15 20 2661 2666 IL-10
# T48 Protein S15 105 109 2751 2755 CD28

This direct effect also may be limited in active RA patients, because their PB CD4+ T cells showed a defective IL-10 inhibition of CD28-costimulated production of both IFN-gamma and IL-2.
# T49 Protein S16 79 82 2866 2869 CD4
# T50 Protein S16 111 116 2898 2903 IL-10

# T52 Protein S16 168 177 2955 2964 IFN-gamma
# T53 Protein S16 182 186 2969 2973 IL-2

Numerous cytokines, both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory, have been detected in the ST of RA, and the balance between these opposing cytokine activities regulates disease severity [10].

Endogenous IL-10, produced mainly by macrophages and T cells, inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production by ST cells [12].
# T96 Protein S18 11 16 3178 3183 IL-10

However, this regulatory activity seems to be restricted during chronic inflammation.

The activation of both the extracellular stimulus-regulated kinase and p38 kinase pathways, induced by TNF-alpha and IL-1, inhibits the Jak1-STAT3 signaling pathway shared by IL-10 and IL-6 in adhered macrophages [13].
# T97 Protein S20 103 112 3481 3490 TNF-alpha
# T98 Protein S20 117 121 3495 3499 IL-1

# T100 Protein S20 141 146 3519 3524 STAT3
# T101 Protein S20 175 180 3553 3558 IL-10
# T102 Protein S20 185 189 3563 3567 IL-6

More importantly, IL-10-mediated STAT3 activation is mostly undetectable in RA synovial macrophages.
# T103 Protein S21 18 23 3615 3620 IL-10
# T104 Protein S21 33 38 3630 3635 STAT3

This impaired IL-10 signaling is probably induced by chronic exposure to immune complexes in vivo, because both cell surface IL-10R1 expression and IL-10-induced Jak1 activation are suppressed in IFN-gamma-primed macrophages by a protein kinase C-dependent pathway following ligation of the IgG Fc gamma receptor [14].
# T105 Protein S22 14 19 3712 3717 IL-10
# T106 Protein S22 125 132 3823 3830 IL-10R1

# T108 Protein S22 162 166 3860 3864 Jak1
# T109 Protein S22 196 205 3894 3903 IFN-gamma

Furthermore, dendritic cells from RA synovial fluids are resistant to the immunoregulatory effect of IL-10 due to decreased transport of intracellular IL-10R1 in the presence of proinflammatory cytokine stimuli such as TNF-alpha, IL-1, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [15].
# T110 Protein S23 101 106 4118 4123 IL-10
# T111 Protein S23 151 158 4168 4175 IL-10R1

# T113 Protein S23 230 234 4247 4251 IL-1
# T114 Protein S23 240 288 4257 4305 granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor

We have demonstrated that the resistance of RA CD4+ T cells to IL-10 may be associated with defective IL-10-dependent STAT3 activation, but not with IL-10R1 expression.
# T115 Protein S24 47 50 4359 4362 CD4
# T116 Protein S24 63 68 4375 4380 IL-10
# T117 Protein S24 102 107 4414 4419 IL-10
# T118 Protein S24 118 123 4430 4435 STAT3
# T119 Protein S24 149 156 4461 4468 IL-10R1

Inhibitory effects of IL-10 on these inflammatory cell types are therefore differentially modulated at the signal transduction level under the inflammatory environment in RA.
# T120 Protein S25 22 27 4503 4508 IL-10

In association with impaired IL-10-mediated STAT3 activation, STAT3 was found to be tyrosine phosphorylated persistently (up to 6 hours) in freshly isolated PB and ST CD4+ T cells from RA patients.
# T121 Protein S26 29 34 4685 4690 IL-10
# T122 Protein S26 44 49 4700 4705 STAT3
# T123 Protein S26 62 67 4718 4723 STAT3
# T124 Protein S26 167 170 4823 4826 CD4

STAT3 is activated by a variety of cytokines, notably the IL-6 family of cytokines (e.g. IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin M) and growth factors, in addition to IL-10 [4].
# T125 Protein S27 0 5 4854 4859 STAT3
# T126 Protein S27 89 93 4943 4947 IL-6
# T127 Protein S27 95 100 4949 4954 IL-11
# T128 Protein S27 102 128 4956 4982 leukemia inhibitory factor
# T129 Protein S27 134 146 4988 5000 oncostatin M
# T130 Protein S27 183 188 5037 5042 IL-10

Of these cytokines, IL-6 plays a predominant role in eliciting a systemic reaction such as the acute phase response in active RA, due mainly to its abundance in the blood circulation [27].
# T131 Protein S28 20 24 5068 5072 IL-6

Consistent with this notion, IL-6 was the major STAT3-activating factor contained in the serum of active RA patients, and the responsiveness to IL-10 was suppressed in normal CD4+ T cells after 36 hours of incubation with IL-6.
# T132 Protein S29 29 33 5266 5270 IL-6
# T133 Protein S29 48 53 5285 5290 STAT3
# T134 Protein S29 144 149 5381 5386 IL-10
# T135 Protein S29 175 178 5412 5415 CD4
# T136 Protein S29 222 226 5459 5463 IL-6

These results suggest that both the sustained STAT3 activation and the resistance to IL-10 inhibition found in RA CD4+ T cells may be induced after chronic exposure in vivo to high concentrations of serum IL-6.
# T137 Protein S30 46 51 5511 5516 STAT3
# T138 Protein S30 85 90 5550 5555 IL-10
# T139 Protein S30 114 117 5579 5582 CD4
# T140 Protein S30 205 209 5670 5674 IL-6

However, it is also possible that STAT3 activity could be constitutively induced in CD4+ T cells by their own IL-10 secretion, leading to the loss of sensitivity to exogenous IL-10, because RA CD4+ T cells in the ST are capable of producing significant levels of IL-10 [34].
# T141 Protein S31 34 39 5710 5715 STAT3
# T142 Protein S31 84 87 5760 5763 CD4

# T145 Protein S31 193 196 5869 5872 CD4
# T146 Protein S31 263 268 5939 5944 IL-10

CD4+ T cells isolated from the ST of RA also showed a defect in the IL-10-induced STAT3 signaling pathway.
# T147 Protein S32 0 3 5951 5954 CD4
# T148 Protein S32 68 73 6019 6024 IL-10
# T149 Protein S32 82 87 6033 6038 STAT3

It is most probable that the resistance of CD4+ T cells to IL-10 can be even augmented after migration into the inflamed ST, because IL-6 is highly concentrated compared with the blood level [27].
# T150 Protein S33 43 46 6101 6104 CD4
# T151 Protein S33 59 64 6117 6122 IL-10
# T152 Protein S33 133 137 6191 6195 IL-6

In addition, the involvement of other essential proinflammatory cytokines in this process was suggested by our preliminary experiments demonstrating that IL-10-mediated IFN-gamma inhibition in CD4+ T cells was reduced by pretreatment with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, although less effectively than by IL-6 (data not shown).
# T153 Protein S34 154 159 6409 6414 IL-10
# T154 Protein S34 169 178 6424 6433 IFN-gamma

# T158 Protein S34 297 301 6552 6556 IL-6

Furthermore, IFN-gamma and IL-10 produced by CD4+ T cells themselves could be responsible for impaired IL-10 signaling in the ST, because T-cell infiltrates produce both cytokines [34,35].
# T159 Protein S35 13 22 6588 6597 IFN-gamma
# T160 Protein S35 27 32 6602 6607 IL-10
# T161 Protein S35 45 48 6620 6623 CD4
# T162 Protein S35 103 108 6678 6683 IL-10

In an autocrine fashion, IL-10 may persistently stimulate STAT3 activation and IFN-gamma can induce SOCS1 protein as a crosstalk inhibitor of IL-10 signaling [32].
# T163 Protein S36 25 30 6789 6794 IL-10
# T164 Protein S36 58 63 6822 6827 STAT3

# T167 Protein S36 142 147 6906 6911 IL-10

The T-cell-inhibitory effect of IL-10 may therefore be modulated complicatedly upon exposure to an inflammatory environment in RA joints, where many cytokines are present substantially [10].
# T168 Protein S37 32 37 6960 6965 IL-10

STAT3 activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of RA.
# T210 Protein S38 0 5 7119 7124 STAT3

Active STAT3 is constitutively expressed in synovial fluid mononuclear cells from RA patients [36].
# T211 Protein S39 7 12 7190 7195 STAT3

IL-6 is the major STAT3-activating factor present in synovial fluid, which has a crucial role in the activation of monocyte functions such as gene expression of the Fc gamma receptor type I and type III and of HLA-DR [31].
# T212 Protein S40 0 4 7283 7287 IL-6
# T213 Protein S40 18 23 7301 7306 STAT3

# T215 Protein S40 194 202 7477 7485 type III

More recently, high levels of activated STAT3, thought to be induced mainly by IL-6, have been detected in the ST, and STAT3 activation has been shown to be involved in synovial fibroblast proliferation and IL-6 production [37].
# T216 Protein S41 40 45 7546 7551 STAT3
# T217 Protein S41 79 83 7585 7589 IL-6
# T218 Protein S41 119 124 7625 7630 STAT3
# T219 Protein S41 207 211 7713 7717 IL-6

In this regard, STAT3 is critical in the survival and expansion of growth factor-dependent synovial fibroblasts [38].
# T220 Protein S42 16 21 7751 7756 STAT3

Furthermore, the significance of persistent STAT3 signaling in Th1-cell-dominated autoimmune arthritis has been suggested by studies of the gp130F759/F759 mice, in which the Src homology phosphatase-2 binding site of gp130 (the transmembrane glycoprotein beta subunit of the IL-6 family cytokine receptor), tyrosine 759, was mutated to phenylalanine [39].

# T224 Protein S43 228 304 8081 8157 transmembrane glycoprotein beta subunit of the IL-6 family cytokine receptor

In the gp130F759/F759 mice, T cells, particularly the CD4+ T-cell subset, are chronically activated and resistant to activation-induced cell death through gp130-mediated STAT3 activation.

# T228 Protein S44 170 175 8379 8384 STAT3

The longevity of cytokine signals transduced by the JAK-STAT pathway is regulated by the SOCS family proteins [7].

We found that CD4+ T cells from patients with active RA expressed higher levels of SOCS1, but lower levels of SOCS3, compared with normal CD4+ T cells.
# T229 Protein S46 14 17 8526 8529 CD4

# T231 Protein S46 110 115 8622 8627 SOCS3
# T232 Protein S46 138 141 8650 8653 CD4

SOCS1 prevents activation of JAK by directly binding to JAK, and SOCS3 inhibits the action of JAK by binding to the Src homology phosphatase-2-binding domain of receptors such as gp130 [40].
# T233 Protein S47 0 5 8664 8669 SOCS1
# T234 Protein S47 65 70 8729 8734 SOCS3
# T235 Protein S47 179 184 8843 8848 gp130

SOCS1 and SOCS3 are induced by various cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-10, as mediators of negative feedback and crosstalk inhibition [7].

# T239 Protein S48 69 74 8924 8929 IL-10

Recent studies with mice lacking SOCS3 or SOCS1 revealed that SOCS3 is a negative regulator of IL-6 signaling but not of IL-10 signaling.

# T244 Protein S49 121 126 9116 9121 IL-10

Studies of conditional SOCS3-deficient mice have shown that SOCS3 deficiency, but not SOCS1 deficiency, results in sustained activation of STAT3 in response to IL-6 [8,41].

# T248 Protein S50 139 144 9272 9277 STAT3
# T249 Protein S50 160 164 9293 9297 IL-6

The analysis of SOCS3-deficient macrophages has indicated that SOCS3 is a crucial inhibitor of the IL-6-induced transcriptional response [42].
# T250 Protein S51 16 21 9322 9327 SOCS3
# T251 Protein S51 63 68 9369 9374 SOCS3
# T252 Protein S51 99 103 9405 9409 IL-6

However, SOCS3 is dispensable for both the negative feedback inhibition and the immunoregulatory action of IL-10 in macrophages [41].
# T253 Protein S52 9 14 9458 9463 SOCS3
# T254 Protein S52 107 112 9556 9561 IL-10

On the contrary, SOCS1 was found to directly inhibit IL-10-mediated signaling [43].
# T255 Protein S53 17 22 9600 9605 SOCS1
# T256 Protein S53 53 58 9636 9641 IL-10

Increased SOCS1 expression in RA CD4+ T cells may therefore be associated with both the impaired responsiveness to IL-10 and to IL-10-mediated STAT3 activation, and defective SOCS3 expression may be responsible for persistent STAT3 activation in response to serum IL-6.
# T257 Protein S54 10 15 9677 9682 SOCS1

# T264 Protein S54 264 268 9931 9935 IL-6

There is a possibility that SOCS1 induction may be associated with the ability of CD4+ T cells to produce IFN-gamma, because CD4+ T cells from active RA could produce high levels of IFN-gamma in the presence of IL-10, and because IFN-gamma has been known as a potent inducer of SOCS1 [32].

It is of interest in this regard to indicate that polarized Th1 and Th2 cells express high levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA, respectively [44].

IL-12-induced STAT4 activation is inhibited by SOCS3 induction in Th2 cells, whereas IL-4-induced STAT6 signaling is diminished by SOCS1 induction in Th1 cells.

SOCS1 and SOCS3 may thus have important roles as Th1-specific and Th2-specific, mutually exclusive, cross-talk repressors of the IL-4-STAT6 and the IL-12-STAT4 signaling pathways, respectively.

Consistent with this notion, PB T cells from patients with allergic diseases significantly express high levels of SOCS3 transcripts, and the SOCS3 expression correlates well with serum IgE levels and disease pathology [45].

Higher SOCS1 expression with lower SOCS3 expression in PB CD4+ T cells from RA patients, compared with healthy controls, is therefore probably consistent with their systemic bias towards a Th1 phenotype, as has previously been demonstrated [46-49].
