Inhibition of tumor development in CCR5-/- mice.

A-C, Tumor images, volumes, and weights.

B16 melanoma cells (5x105 cells/mouse) were inoculated s.c. into CCR5+/+ mice and CCR5-/- mice (n = 20).
# T2 Protein S3 65 69 155 159 CCR5
# T3 Protein S3 82 86 172 176 CCR5

Tumor volumes were measured every day and tumor weights were measured at study termination (Day 31).

The CCR5-/- mice had a significant reduction in tumor growth and volume as compared to CCR5+/+ mice.
# T4 Protein S5 4 8 300 304 CCR5
# T5 Protein S5 87 91 383 387 CCR5

The results are expressed as mean +/- SD.

* indicates significant difference from CCR5+/+ mice (P<0.05).
# T6 Protein S7 40 44 479 483 CCR5

D, The CCR5-/- mice demonstrated significantly higher survival rates compared to CCR5+/+ mice (by Log-rank Test).
# T7 Protein S8 7 11 509 513 CCR5
# T8 Protein S8 81 85 583 587 CCR5

E. Tumor sections were analyzed by H&E stain and expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) by immunohistochemistry.

Data are means +/- S.D. of four experimental animals.

* indicates significant difference from CCR5+/+ mice (P<0.05).
# T9 Protein S11 40 44 840 844 CCR5

Scale bar indicates 50 m.
