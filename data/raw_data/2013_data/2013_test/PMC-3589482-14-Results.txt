The SerpinB2 Proximal Promoter Confers LPS Responsiveness
# T1 Protein S1 4 12 4 12 SerpinB2

To investigate cis-acting regulatory elements responsive to LPS in the 5' flanking region of the murine SerpinB2 gene, nucleotides -4480 to +92 and a series of generated deletion mutants of the 5' flanking region were cloned upstream of a promoter-less firefly luciferase reporter gene (pGL3 Basic) (Fig. 2A).
# T2 Protein S2 104 112 162 170 SerpinB2
# T3 Protein S2 261 271 319 329 luciferase

The reporter constructs were then transiently transfected into sub-confluent RAW264.7 macrophages and assayed for luciferase activity in the presence and absence of LPS or PMA, for comparison.

PMA-induced SerpinB2 gene regulation has been extensively studied in human macrophage cell lines [45]-[47], and has been shown to occur through several proximal and distal AP-1 responsive elements [30]; [37]; [47]-[51].
# T5 Protein S4 12 20 573 581 SerpinB2

As shown in Fig. 2B, the SerpinB2 5' flanking region from -4480 to +92 directs both PMA- and LPS-inducible transcription, approximately 2-fold and 7-fold, respectively.
# T6 Protein S5 25 33 806 814 SerpinB2

Deletion of the murine SerpinB2 promoter from -1686 to -1341 increased LPS-inducibility to approximately 16-fold, indicating the presence of a silencer element in this region.
# T7 Protein S6 23 31 973 981 SerpinB2

Further deletion beyond -539 abolished the LPS-response of the promoter, indicating the presence of an essential LPS response element in the region between -539 and -189; however, the response of the murine SerpinB2 promoter to PMA is less affected by this deletion.
# T8 Protein S7 207 215 1333 1341 SerpinB2

While deletion of the SerpinB2 promoter from -189 to -87 eliminated the LPS response and marginally reduced the PMA response, the -87 murine SerpinB2 promoter construct was still partially responsive to PMA, indicating that cis-acting elements mediating the response of the murine SerpinB2 promoter to PMA also lie downstream of nucleotide -87.
# T9 Protein S8 22 30 1415 1423 SerpinB2
# T10 Protein S8 141 149 1534 1542 SerpinB2
# T11 Protein S8 281 289 1674 1682 SerpinB2
