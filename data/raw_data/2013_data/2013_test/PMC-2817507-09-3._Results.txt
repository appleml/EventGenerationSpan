TLR4 mRNA Increased in Brain Tissue after ICH
# T1 Protein S2 0 4 5 9 TLR4

TLR4 mRNA levels were detected by Rt-PCR.
# T2 Protein S3 0 4 51 55 TLR4

The low level of TLR4 mRNA was observed in normal rat brain tissue.
# T3 Protein S4 17 21 110 114 TLR4

In the saline control group, the TLR4 mRNA slightly increased, but was not significantly different from normal group.
# T4 Protein S5 33 37 194 198 TLR4

However, the TLR4 mRNA after ICH significantly increased starting from 6 hours after ICH (P < .05), peaked on the 3rd day after ICH, and then decreased on the 7th day after ICH (P < .05), but still maintained a higher level compared with saline control (P < .05, Figure 1).
# T5 Protein S6 13 17 292 296 TLR4
