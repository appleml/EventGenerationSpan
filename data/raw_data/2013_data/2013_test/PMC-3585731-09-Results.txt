Expression of Constitutively Active Akt, Rescues Necroptosis Under Serum Free Conditions

We used L929 cells stably expressing constitutively active wild type Akt1 (Myr-Akt) or the catalytically inactive mutant K179M in order to further understand the contribution of growth factors and RIP1 kinase to Akt activation during necroptosis.
# T1 Protein S2 69 73 158 162 Akt1
# T2 Protein S2 75 82 164 171 Myr-Akt
# T3 Protein S2 121 126 210 215 K179M
# T4 Protein S2 197 201 286 290 RIP1

Constitutively active Akt1 (Myr-Akt) was generated as previously described [37] by the addition of a myristoylation signal which provides constitutive localization to the plasma membrane and by the deletion of the auto-inhibitory PH domain (Fig. 7A) resulting in an Akt that is active under serum free.
# T5 Protein S3 22 26 358 362 Akt1
# T6 Protein S3 28 35 364 371 Myr-Akt

It is important to note that the cells expressing Myr-Akt were viable, grew in a manner indistinguishable from the empty vector control cells, and were not triggered to induce necroptosis by serum starvation (Fig. 7B).
# T7 Protein S4 50 57 689 696 Myr-Akt

This indicates that active Akt alone is not sufficient to induce necroptotic cell death.

Under serum free conditions Myr-Akt, but not the K179M mutant, fully restored zVAD.fmk-induced necroptosis (Fig. 7A,B).
# T8 Protein S6 28 35 975 982 Myr-Akt
# T9 Protein S6 49 54 996 1001 K179M

Nec-1 prevented both Myr-Akt dependent cell death and the necroptosis-specific delayed increase in Akt Thr308 phosphorylation (Fig. 7B,C).
# T10 Protein S7 21 28 1088 1095 Myr-Akt

Myr-Akt also allowed other zVAD.fmk-dependent events, including activation of JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 7C) and upregulation of TNFalpha mRNA (Fig. 7D) to occur under serum free conditions, confirming an important role for Akt at the apex of necroptotic signaling.
# T11 Protein S8 86 91 1292 1297 c-Jun
# T12 Protein S8 138 146 1344 1352 TNFalpha

These data demonstrated that the presence of active and membrane localized Akt is sufficient to uncouple Akt activation during necroptosis from growth factor signaling.

RIP1 kinase was still able to regulate Akt activation during necroptosis, suggesting that growth factors and RIP1 kinase provide two independent inputs required for Akt changes during necroptosis.
# T13 Protein S10 0 4 1650 1654 RIP1
# T14 Protein S10 109 113 1759 1763 RIP1

RIP1 kinase-dependent Thr308 phosphorylation of Myr-Akt during necroptosis increased Myr-Akt activity as it did with endogenous Akt (Fig. 5).
# T15 Protein S11 0 4 1847 1851 RIP1
# T16 Protein S11 48 55 1895 1902 Myr-Akt
# T17 Protein S11 85 92 1932 1939 Myr-Akt

Phosphorylation of many previously described Akt substrates was increased upon the expression of Myr-Akt, but not the K179M mutant, confirming that these molecules are Akt substrates in L929 cells (Fig. 7C).
# T18 Protein S12 97 104 2086 2093 Myr-Akt
# T19 Protein S12 118 123 2107 2112 K179M

The effect of zVAD.fmk on their phosphorylation varied, likely due to the increased basal activity of Myr-Akt.
# T20 Protein S13 102 109 2299 2306 Myr-Akt

Some substrates, including p70S6K, S6, GSK-3 and FoxO4, were fully phosphorylated even in the absence of zVAD.fmk.
# T21 Protein S14 27 33 2335 2341 p70S6K
# T22 Protein S14 35 37 2343 2345 S6
# T23 Protein S14 49 54 2357 2362 FoxO4

On the other hand, phosphorylation of FoxO1 and MDM2 was significantly increased in the presence of zVAD.fmk, indicating that necroptotic Thr308 phosphorylation of Myr-Akt still promoted its activity.
# T24 Protein S15 38 43 2461 2466 FoxO1
# T25 Protein S15 48 52 2471 2475 MDM2
# T26 Protein S15 164 171 2587 2594 Myr-Akt

Under serum free conditions all zVAD.fmk-induced downstream events (cell death, JNK activation, TNFalpha production) were dependent on the over expressed Myr-Akt.
# T44 Protein S16 96 104 2720 2728 TNFalpha
# T45 Protein S16 154 161 2778 2785 Myr-Akt

This allowed us to examine the effects of other Akt mutations on necroptosis.

First, we found that membrane localization of Akt is required.

Full length Akt or a mutant lacking both the PH domain and the Myr tag did not support the activation of cell death or increased Thr308 phosphorylation following zVAD.fmk addition under serum free conditions (Fig.

S8A,B).

Second, we found a specific and critical role for Thr308 phosphorylation in the regulation of the necroptotic functions of Akt.

It has been reported that Ala mutations at Thr308 and Ser473 cause a reduction in the catalytic activity of Akt, while Asp mutants increase activity [38].
# T46 Protein S22 108 111 3386 3389 Akt

We examined the effect of Ala and Asp mutants at both sites during necroptosis.

In our hands, both Asp mutants displayed activity comparable to wild type Akt, while both Ala mutants displayed comparable decreases in activity (Fig.

S8C).

Despite similar catalytic activities, Thr308 and Ser473 mutants displayed major differences in their ability to promote necroptotic changes (Fig. 7E,F,G).

As expected, the S473D mutant, which was phosphorylated on Thr308 after the addition of zVAD, displayed only slightly reduced activity, while S473A was significantly less active in all aspects of necroptosis.
# T47 Protein S27 17 29 3842 3854 S473D mutant
# T48 Protein S27 142 147 3967 3972 S473A

S473A was unable to be efficiently phosphorylated on Thr308 possibly due to the inability of the Ala mutated 473 site to be phosphorylated and provide a docking site for PDK1 to phosphorylate Thr308 [39].
# T49 Protein S28 0 5 4034 4039 S473A
# T50 Protein S28 170 174 4204 4208 PDK1

Strikingly, both Ala and Asp mutants of Thr308 were significantly less active in promoting cell death, phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun, and TNFalpha mRNA.
# T51 Protein S29 130 135 4369 4374 c-Jun
# T52 Protein S29 141 149 4380 4388 TNFalpha

This suggests that T308D, in spite of being an active Akt construct, may not be a perfect mimic of phosphorylation and this mutant form of the kinase may not have sufficient activity to phosphorylate the entire repertoire of substrates in the cells.
# T53 Protein S30 19 24 4414 4419 T308D

When tested, T308D did not support the downstream phosphorylation of several substrates that were phosphorylated by the Myr-Akt construct in the presence of zVAD including FoxO1, Foxo4, MDM2, and p70S6K (Fig.
# T54 Protein S31 13 18 4658 4663 T308D
# T55 Protein S31 120 127 4765 4772 Myr-Akt
# T56 Protein S31 172 177 4817 4822 FoxO1
# T57 Protein S31 179 184 4824 4829 Foxo4
# T58 Protein S31 186 190 4831 4835 MDM2
# T59 Protein S31 196 202 4841 4847 p70S6K

S8D).

Our model, based on these results, is that necroptosis-specific Thr308 phosphorylation provides a critical link between necroptotic machinery and Akt kinase, allowing Akt to phosphorylate substrates during necroptosis, promote TNFalpha synthesis, JNK activation and eventual cell death.
