Differential recruitment of C/EBP-beta and C/EBP-betaT217 to the murine SerpinB2 promoter in vivo.
# T1 Protein S1 28 38 28 38 C/EBP-beta
# T2 Protein S1 72 80 72 80 SerpinB2

Transcription factor occupancy on the SerpinB2 proximal promoter in vivo was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay.
# T3 Protein S2 38 46 137 145 SerpinB2

RAW264.7 macrophages were treated in the presence or absence of LPS for the indicated times and chromatin immunoprecipitation performed using antibodies against C/EBP-beta or p-C/EBP-beta (T217).
# T4 Protein S3 161 171 395 405 C/EBP-beta
# T5 Protein S3 175 194 409 428 p-C/EBP-beta (T217)

Soluble chromatin (600-700 ng) was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against C/EBP-beta, p-C/EBP-beta (T217), RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII), or a rabbit IgG (rIgG) control.
# T6 Protein S4 78 88 508 518 C/EBP-beta
# T7 Protein S4 90 109 520 539 p-C/EBP-beta (T217)

(A) Typical PCR pattern obtained in ChIP assays using murine SerpinB2 proximal promoter-specific primers, 338/-315 and -5/+19, as diagrammed in top.
# T8 Protein S5 61 69 662 670 SerpinB2

Recruitment of RNAPII to the SerpinB2 promoter suggests active transcription following LPS stimulation.
# T9 Protein S6 29 37 779 787 SerpinB2

Minimal background was detected using the rabbit IgG control, indicative of the specificity of the ChIP reaction.

(B) qPCR analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitated with antibodies against C/EBP-beta, p-C/EBP-beta (T217), and the rIgG control.
# T10 Protein S8 74 84 1042 1052 C/EBP-beta
# T11 Protein S8 86 105 1054 1073 p-C/EBP-beta (T217)

The data are represented relative to rIgG signal using the 2-deltadeltaCt method.
# T12 Protein S9 37 41 1134 1138 rIgG
