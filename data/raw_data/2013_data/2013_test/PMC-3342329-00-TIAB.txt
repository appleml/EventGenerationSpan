B and Upregulation of IL-1Ra in Melanoma Model
# T2 Protein S2 22 28 112 118 IL-1Ra

To evaluate the relevance of C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) expression and tumor development, we compared melanoma growth in CCR5 knockout (CCR5-/-) mice and wild type (CCR5+/+) mice.
# T3 Protein S3 29 58 166 195 C-C chemokine receptor type 5
# T4 Protein S3 60 64 197 201 CCR5
# T5 Protein S3 131 135 268 272 CCR5
# T6 Protein S3 146 150 283 287 CCR5
# T7 Protein S3 175 179 312 316 CCR5

CCR5-/- mice showed reduced tumor volume, tumor weight, and increased survival rate when compared to CCR5+/+ mice.

# T9 Protein S4 101 105 428 432 CCR5

We investigated the activation of NF-kappaB since it is an implicated transcription factor in the regulation of genes involving cell growth, apoptosis, and tumor growth.

Significant inhibition of DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB, and translocation of p50 and p65 into the nucleus through the inhibition of phosphorylation of IkappaB was found in the melanoma tissues of CCR5-/- mice compared to melanoma tissues of CCR5+/+ mice.
# T10 Protein S6 82 85 694 697 p50
# T11 Protein S6 90 93 702 705 p65
# T12 Protein S6 201 205 813 817 CCR5
# T13 Protein S6 246 250 858 862 CCR5

NF-kappaB target apoptotic protein expression, such as cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, and Bax, was elevated, whereas the survival protein expression levels, such as Bcl-2, C-IAP1, was decreased in the melanoma tissues of CCR5-/- mice.
# T14 Protein S7 174 180 1046 1052 C-IAP1
# T15 Protein S7 223 227 1095 1099 CCR5

Interestingly, we found that the level of IL-1Ra, a tumor growth suppressive cytokine, was significantly elevated in tumor tissue and spleen of CCR5-/- mice compared to the level in CCR5+/+ mice.
# T16 Protein S8 42 48 1151 1157 IL-1Ra
# T17 Protein S8 144 148 1253 1257 CCR5
# T18 Protein S8 182 186 1291 1295 CCR5

Moreover, infiltration of CD8+ cytotoxic T cell and CD57+ natural killer cells was significantly increased in melanoma tumor and spleen tissue of CCR5-/- mice compared to that of CCR5+/+ mice.
# T19 Protein S9 146 150 1451 1455 CCR5
# T20 Protein S9 179 183 1484 1488 CCR5

Therefore, these results showed that CCR5 deficiency caused apoptotic cell death of melanoma through inhibition of NF-kappaB and upregulation of IL-1Ra.
