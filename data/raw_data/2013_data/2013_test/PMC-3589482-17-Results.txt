The C/EBP Element is Bound by an LPS-induced Nuclear Factor from RAW 264.7 Macrophages

Nuclear factor binding to the putative C/EBP element (-203/-192) was investigated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using nuclear extracts from untreated and LPS-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages.

Three different double stranded oligonucleotide probes were used for EMSA, representing (1) the putative SerpinB2 C/EBP element (-203/-192), (2) a mutant SerpinB2 element containing the same mutation as in pGLmP-539mC/EBP and (3) the rat albumin promoter distal element 1 (DEI) region containing a high affinity C/EBP binding site.

Four bands of different mobilities, representing DNA-nuclear protein complexes were detected (Fig. 5A).

Three of these bands (I, II, III) represent complexes with single stranded DNA (Fig. 5A) while the uppermost (slowest migrating) complex was induced by LPS.

The LPS-inducible complex was not detected using the mutant C/EBP oligonucleotide probe and could be abolished by an excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide, carrying either the same sequence (Fig. 5B, lanes 4 and 5) or the sequence of a known C/EBP binding site from the rat albumin promoter (Fig. 5B, lanes 8 and 9), but not by the mutated oligonucleotide (Fig. 5B, lanes 6 and 7).

Together these data indicate that the putative SerpinB2 C/EBP site at -203/-192 binds a LPS-inducible complex that is likely to contain a member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors.
