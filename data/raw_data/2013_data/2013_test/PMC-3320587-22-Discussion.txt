The transcription factor NFAT5 is the most evolutionarily divergent member of the Rel family of NFAT proteins [57].
# T1 Protein S1 25 30 25 30 NFAT5

Unlike the other NFAT proteins (NFATp, NFATc, NFAT3, and NFAT4), NFAT5 binds DNA as an obligate dimer in a fashion resembling NF-kappaB proteins [58], is calcineurin independent, and does not cooperate with the basic region-leucine zipper proteins Fos and Jun in gene activation ([59], [60], reviewed in [61]-[63]).
# T2 Protein S2 32 37 148 153 NFATp
# T3 Protein S2 39 44 155 160 NFATc
# T4 Protein S2 46 51 162 167 NFAT3
# T5 Protein S2 57 62 173 178 NFAT4

# T8 Protein S2 248 251 364 367 Fos
# T9 Protein S2 256 259 372 375 Jun

To date, osmotic stress, integrin activation, and T cell-stimulation have been shown to regulate NFAT5 activity [59], [64], [65].
# T10 Protein S3 97 102 529 534 NFAT5

Based on our demonstration here that the host innate immune response to MTb infection induces MyD88-dependent upregulation of NFAT5 gene expression, we have expanded this list to include MTb as an additional stimulus.
# T11 Protein S4 94 99 656 661 MyD88
# T12 Protein S4 126 131 688 693 NFAT5

We have linked this observation to MTb-stimulated HIV-1 gene expression by showing that MTb enhances the replication of HIV-1 subtypes B and C via a direct interaction between NFAT5 and the viral promoter.
# T13 Protein S5 176 181 956 961 NFAT5

Thus, HIV-1 has co-opted NFAT5, which is induced as part of the innate immune response to TB, for enhanced viral transcription/replication.
# T14 Protein S6 25 30 1011 1016 NFAT5

NF-kappaB is activated after MTb engagement of PRRs [20], [66].

Multiple studies of HIV-1 activation have shown that initial recruitment of the NF-kappaB p50/p65 heterodimer to the HIV-1 proviral enhancer region is crucial for HIV gene transcription (reviewed in [67], [68]).
# T15 Protein S8 90 93 1280 1283 p50
# T16 Protein S8 94 97 1284 1287 p65

Upon interaction with the viral LTR, NF-kappaB rapidly induces hyperacetylation of histones associated with nucleosome 1 (nuc-1) at the HIV-1 transcription start site, resulting in recruitment of the pTEFb complex, which is required for RNA pol II processivity ([69], reviewed in [68], [70]).

In this report we directly examined the relative roles of NFAT5 and NF-kappaB p50/p65 in HIV-1 replication under conditions of activation by MTb co-infection, when NF-kappaB levels in the nucleus are elevated.
# T17 Protein S10 58 63 1753 1758 NFAT5
# T18 Protein S10 78 81 1773 1776 p50
# T19 Protein S10 82 85 1777 1780 p65

We found that specific disruption of the NFAT5 binding site(s) in R5-tropic subtype B or subtype C infectious molecular clones significantly reduced virus replication in PBMC or MDM co-infected with a clinical isolate of MTb.

Thus, NF-kappaB binding to the viral LTR is not sufficient to compensate for the loss of NFAT5 binding to the LTR under conditions of MTb co-infection.
# T20 Protein S12 89 94 2220 2225 NFAT5

Reciprocally, an intact NFAT5 site could not compensate for disruption of the two NF-kappaB sites.

Thus, both factors are required for MTb-induced HIV-1 replication.

Intriguingly, both in the absence and presence of MTb co-infection, disruption of NF-kappaB site II consistently resulted in greater suppression of virus replication than disruption of NF-kappaB site I. Consistent with these findings, synthetic reporter assays have previously shown that these two sites have distinct roles in driving transcription.

The downstream NF-kappaB site I binding site, which is directly upstream of three highly conserved Sp binding sites, appears to enhance Sp protein recruitment to the LTR [71]-[73].

Because NF-kappaB site I overlaps the NFAT5 binding site, it is possible that loss of NF-kappaB binding to this site is mitigated, at least in part, by increased NFAT5 binding to the mutated site.
# T34 Protein S17 162 167 3142 3147 NFAT5

This hypothesis is consistent with our quantitative DNase I footprinting analysis that shows that specific disruption of NF-kappaB site I results in enhanced binding of NFAT5 to the LTR.
# T35 Protein S18 52 59 3229 3236 DNase I
# T36 Protein S18 169 174 3346 3351 NFAT5

HIV-1 subtype C now makes up greater than 50% of all HIV-1 infections worldwide, and its prevalence is especially high in regions of endemic TB [1], [2], [28], [52], Most HIV-1 subtype C isolates possess three NF-kappaB binding sites in the LTR [30].

Our analysis of MTb whole lysate-stimulated, LTR-driven reporter gene expression from representative B, C, and E LTRs showed that LTRs derived from subtype C isolates were superior in driving reporter gene expression as compared to LTRs derived from subtype B or E isolates.

Other studies have found that, in response to TNF, subtype C LTRs drive reporter gene transcription more strongly than other subtype LTRs [38], [39].
# T37 Protein S21 46 49 3936 3939 TNF

In the co-infection model utilized in this report, in which clinical isolates of both MTb and HIV-1 subtype C were used to infect freshly prepared human peripheral blood cells, we found that specific disruption of NFAT5 binding to the LTR significantly impaired viral replication during MTb co-infection, indicating that even the presence of three intact NF-kappaB binding sites, which is typical for HIV-1 subtype C isolates [30], cannot compensate for loss of NFAT5 recruitment to the viral LTR in the context of MTb co-infection.
# T38 Protein S22 214 219 4254 4259 NFAT5
# T39 Protein S22 462 467 4502 4507 NFAT5

Given that the NF-kappaB and NFAT5 binding motifs overlap, how do NF-kappaB and NFAT5 function at this overlapping or shared site in the LTR to drive viral transcription in response to MTb infection?
# T40 Protein S23 80 85 4653 4658 NFAT5

Because NFAT5 expression continues to rise for at least 48 hours post-MTb infection (Figure 2A), one possibility is that the host factors NF-kappaB and NFAT5 associate with the LTR at different stages after viral activation.
# T41 Protein S24 8 13 4781 4786 NFAT5
# T42 Protein S24 152 157 4925 4930 NFAT5

While NF-kappaB presence in the nucleus declines in the hours post MTb infection [74], [75], NFAT5 levels escalate.
# T43 Protein S25 93 98 5091 5096 NFAT5

Thus, NFAT5, which is pivotal for HIV-1 transcription in unstimulated cells [31], may, after Mtb infection, perpetuate viral transcriptional initiation begun by NF-kappaB and, with Tat levels also elevated, promote high levels of sustained HIV-1 transcription.
# T44 Protein S26 6 11 5120 5125 NFAT5
# T45 Protein S26 181 184 5295 5298 Tat

Indeed, in response to hypertonic stress, NFAT5 binds to the aldose reductase (AR) promoter and induces rapid hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 [76].
# T46 Protein S27 42 47 5417 5422 NFAT5
# T47 Protein S27 61 77 5436 5452 aldose reductase
# T48 Protein S27 79 81 5454 5456 AR

Furthermore, hypertonic stress of mouse renal collecting duct epithelial cells results in NFAT5 and NF-kappaB complex formation at NF-kappaB-dependent gene promoters [77].
# T49 Protein S28 90 95 5620 5625 NFAT5

Thus, there are precedents for imagining that NFAT5 could function at the HIV-1 LTR by inducing histone remodeling in a manner similar to NF-kappaB ([69], reviewed in [68], [70]) or by directly interacting with NF-kappaB in a cooperative manner.
# T50 Protein S29 46 51 5748 5753 NFAT5

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that NFAT5 is required for the replication of R5-tropic subtype B and subtype C HIV-1 isolates in response to MTb-co-infection of human PBMC and MDM.
# T51 Protein S30 41 46 5989 5994 NFAT5

Functional NF-kappaB interaction with the viral LTR is also required, but fully intact NF-kappaB binding elements are unable to compensate for the loss of NFAT5 recruitment to the viral promoter.
# T52 Protein S31 11 20 6145 6154 NF-kappaB
# T53 Protein S31 155 160 6289 6294 NFAT5

In addition, we have demonstrated that MTb infection or stimulation with the TLR2 ligand PAM3Cys, induces NFAT5 gene expression in human monocytes.
# T54 Protein S32 77 81 6407 6411 TLR2
# T55 Protein S32 106 111 6436 6441 NFAT5

Furthermore, we have shown that MTb stimulation of NFAT5 depends on TLR pathway signaling molecules, including MyD88, IRAK1, and TRAF6.
# T56 Protein S33 51 56 6529 6534 NFAT5
# T57 Protein S33 111 116 6589 6594 MyD88
# T58 Protein S33 118 123 6596 6601 IRAK1
# T59 Protein S33 129 134 6607 6612 TRAF6

Taken together, the findings presented here enhance the general understanding of the innate immune response to MTb infection by showing that NFAT5 is a major mediator of TLR-dependent gene expression; its importance for gene regulation is likely applicable to other MTb- and TLR-regulated genes.
# T60 Protein S34 141 146 6755 6760 NFAT5

Moreover, these data provide molecular insights into MTb regulation of HIV-1 transcription, thereby elucidating several new targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at controlling TB/HIV-1 co-infection.
