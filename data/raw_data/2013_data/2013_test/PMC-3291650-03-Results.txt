A20 negatively regulates IAV-induced gene expression in BMDM

To investigate the role of A20 in the IAV-induced proinflammatory and antiviral innate immune responses, we infected A20 deficient and control BMDM with IAV X-47 (H3N2).

A20 mRNA levels were rapidly induced in wild type BMDM, but not in A20 deficient BMDM, upon viral infection (figure 2A).

Furthermore, A20myel-KO BMDM show enhanced expression of IL-6 and IFNbeta mRNA after IAV infection compared to control cells (figure 2A).
# T1 Protein S4 57 61 409 413 IL-6
# T2 Protein S4 66 73 418 425 IFNbeta

In accordance with these data, cell culture supernatant collected from these cells contained higher levels of TNF and IFNbeta (figure 2B).

# T4 Protein S5 118 125 608 615 IFNbeta

Upon host infection with IAV, alveolar macrophages are an important source of cytokines and chemokines, attracting innate immune cells to the lung during the primary phase of infection.

To test whether A20 directly controls IAV-induced gene expression in alveolar macrophages, we isolated these cells from lungs of A20myel-KO and control littermates and infected them in vitro with IAV X-47.

Expression and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF, the type-I IFN IFNbeta and IFNalpha4 and the chemokines MCP-1 (ccl2) and KC (cxcl1) was significantly higher in IAV infected cells lacking A20 compared to infected wild type cells (figure 2C and figure S1).

# T6 Protein S8 67 70 1088 1091 TNF
# T7 Protein S8 87 94 1108 1115 IFNbeta
# T8 Protein S8 99 108 1120 1129 IFNalpha4
# T9 Protein S8 128 133 1149 1154 MCP-1
# T10 Protein S8 135 139 1156 1160 ccl2
# T11 Protein S8 145 147 1166 1168 KC
# T12 Protein S8 149 154 1170 1175 cxcl1

Taken together these results demonstrate that A20 negatively regulates IAV-induced proinflammatory and antiviral gene expression in alveolar macrophages, consistent with the inhibitory effect of A20 seen on RIG-I-induced NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation.
