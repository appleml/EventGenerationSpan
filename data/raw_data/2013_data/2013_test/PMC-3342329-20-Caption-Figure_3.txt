Induction of apoptotic cell death in tumor tissues of CCR5 -/- mice.
# T1 Protein S1 54 58 54 58 CCR5

A, Apoptotic cells in tumor sections were examined by fluorescence microscopy after DAPI and TUNEL staining as described in material and methods.

The apoptotic index was determined as the number of DAPI-stained, TUNEL-positive cells that were counted.

Values are the mean +/- S.D. of four experimental animals.

* indicates statistically significant differences from CCR5+/+ mice.
# T2 Protein S5 55 59 435 439 CCR5

Scale bar indicates 50 microm.

B and C, Apoptotic protein (cleaved caspase-3 and Bax) in tumor sections were detected by immunofluorescence assay.

The reactive cell number was determined as the number of DAPI-stained, Specific antibody (cleaved caspase-3 and Bax)-positive cells that were counted.

Values are the mean +/- S.D. of four experimental animals.

* indicates statistically significant differences from CCR5+/+ mice.
# T3 Protein S10 55 59 861 865 CCR5

Scale bar indicates 50 microm.

D, The expression of apoptotic proteins was detected by Western blotting using specific antibodies; cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved PARP, Bax, Bcl-2 and c-IAP1 in the tumor tissues.
# T4 Protein S12 167 173 1073 1079 c-IAP1

The beta-actin protein was used as an internal control.
# T5 Protein S13 4 14 1106 1116 beta-actin

Each band is representative of three independent experimental results.

Data are means +/- S.D. of three experimental animals.

* indicates significant difference from CCR5+/+ mice (p<0.05).
# T6 Protein S16 40 44 1324 1328 CCR5
