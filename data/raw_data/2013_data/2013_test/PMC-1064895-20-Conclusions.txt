We have detected a more pronounced production of IL-17 from RA PBMC in response to IL-15 and MCP-1 as well as stimulation by anti-CD3/anti-CD28.
# T1 Protein S1 49 54 49 54 IL-17
# T2 Protein S1 83 88 83 88 IL-15
# T3 Protein S1 93 98 93 98 MCP-1
# T4 Protein S1 139 143 139 143 CD28

We have also shown that upregulation of IL-17 by activated T cells in patients with RA could be the result of activation via the PI3K/Akt pathway with resultant NF-kappaB activation.
# T5 Protein S2 40 45 185 190 IL-17
# T6 Protein S2 134 137 279 282 Akt

Our data provide insights into cellular mechanisms of the regulation of IL-17 production in RA, and highlight the role of T cells, which has hitherto been neglected in RA pathogenesis.
# T7 Protein S3 72 77 400 405 IL-17

Together with recent data on the successful introduction of anti-IL-17 in RA, our results have added information for the future molecular targeting of new therapeutic applications in RA.
# T8 Protein S4 65 70 578 583 IL-17
