Model of RIP1, Akt and JNK dependent signaling in necroptotic L929 cells.
# T1 Protein S1 9 13 9 13 RIP1

Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 during necroptosis requires inputs from both growth factors and RIP1 kinase.
# T2 Protein S2 94 98 168 172 RIP1

Downstream from Akt, JNK activation leads to TNFalpha synthesis.
# T3 Protein S3 45 53 226 234 TNFalpha

Activation of Akt during necroptosis also leads the phosphorylation of several known Akt substrates, such as mTOR, which contribute to the execution of necroptotic death in L929 cells.
