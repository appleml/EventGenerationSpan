A20 inhibits NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation in response to RIG-I stimulation.
# T1 Protein S1 27 31 27 31 IRF3
# T2 Protein S1 58 63 58 63 RIG-I

(A) HEK293T cells were transfected with NF-kappaB (left), IRF3 (middle) or IRF7 dependent luciferase reporter (right) plasmids, together with plasmids expressing RIG-I (2CARD), IRF7 (right) and increasing amounts of A20.
# T3 Protein S2 58 62 135 139 IRF3
# T4 Protein S2 75 79 152 156 IRF7
# T5 Protein S2 90 100 167 177 luciferase
# T6 Protein S2 177 181 254 258 IRF7

Luciferase activity in cell extracts was analyzed in a luminometer.

Numbers are averages +/- SD of 3 samples per set-up.

(B-D) A20myel-KO and wild type (A20myel-WT) BMDM were transfected with LMW poly(I:C) and analyzed at different time points (minutes) after the start of transfection for IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation, and IRF3 phosphorylation by immunoblotting of total cell extracts (B).
# T7 Protein S5 169 181 588 600 IkappaBalpha
# T8 Protein S5 219 223 638 642 IRF3

The band that is non-specifically recognized by the anti-IkappaBalpha antibody (indicated by an asterisk) can be used as a loading control.

Nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB (p65) and IRF3 was analyzed by immunoblotting of cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions (C).
# T9 Protein S7 36 39 881 884 p65
# T10 Protein S7 45 49 890 894 IRF3

Quantification of band density for nuclear p65 and IRF3 is shown in bar graphs (expressed as relative density compared to the first lane;  = time 0).
# T11 Protein S8 43 46 1010 1013 p65
# T12 Protein S8 51 55 1018 1022 IRF3

IL-6, TNF and IFNbeta levels in the supernatant of cells used in (B) were determined by bioassay (IL-6) and ELISA (TNF and IFNbeta) as described in the 'materials and methods' section (D).
# T13 Protein S9 0 4 1117 1121 IL-6
# T14 Protein S9 6 9 1123 1126 TNF
# T15 Protein S9 14 21 1131 1138 IFNbeta
# T16 Protein S9 98 102 1215 1219 IL-6
# T17 Protein S9 115 118 1232 1235 TNF
# T18 Protein S9 123 130 1240 1247 IFNbeta

Data are representative of 2 independent experiments.
