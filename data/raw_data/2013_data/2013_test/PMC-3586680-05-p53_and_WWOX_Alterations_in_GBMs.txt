p53 mutants are considered as unfavorable factors for the effectiveness in radiotherapy and TMZ treatment in glioma cells (Gjerset et al., 1995; Hirose et al., 2001; Squatrito et al., 2010; Blough et al., 2011).
# T1 Protein S1 0 3 0 3 p53

Loss of functional p53 confers sensitivity to TMZ in glioma cells, whereas wild type p53 increases the TMZ resistance (Blough et al., 2011).
# T2 Protein S2 19 22 231 234 p53
# T3 Protein S2 85 88 297 300 p53

p53 mutants reduce TMZ sensitivity in gliomas (Blough et al., 2011).
# T4 Protein S3 0 3 353 356 p53

Altered WWOX expression is shown in GBMs, in which downregulation of WWOX is associated with loss of heterozygosity and promoter methylation (Kosla et al., 2011).
# T5 Protein S4 8 12 430 434 WWOX
# T6 Protein S4 69 73 491 495 WWOX

Recently, we demonstrated that overexpressed WWOX induces apoptosis of glioblastoma U373-MG cells harboring mutant p53 by causing hypoploidy and DNA fragmentation (Chiang et al., 2012).
# T7 Protein S5 45 49 630 634 WWOX
# T8 Protein S5 115 118 700 703 p53

However, ectopic WWOX has no effect with U87-MG expressing wild type p53.
# T9 Protein S6 17 21 788 792 WWOX
# T10 Protein S6 69 72 840 843 p53

Unlike TMZ, WWOX induces apoptosis of U373-MG cells via a mitochondria-independent and caspase-3-independent pathway (Chiang et al., 2012).
# T11 Protein S7 12 16 857 861 WWOX
# T12 Protein S7 87 96 932 941 caspase-3

While the underlying mechanisms are unknown, it is reasonable to assume that the survival of human glioblastoma cells depends upon interactions between the gain-of-function of p53 mutants and WWOX.
# T13 Protein S8 176 179 1161 1164 p53
# T14 Protein S8 192 196 1177 1181 WWOX

Activated WWOX binds wild type p53 with Ser46 phosphorylation (Chang et al., 2005b).
# T15 Protein S9 10 14 1193 1197 WWOX
# T16 Protein S9 31 34 1214 1217 p53

UV irradiation enhances the binding interactions.

Despite the presence of Ser46 in delta40p53, binding of this protein with WWOX remains to be determined.
# T17 Protein S11 33 43 1351 1361 delta40p53
# T18 Protein S11 74 78 1392 1396 WWOX

We postulate that in GBM cells, both wild type p53 and ectopic WWOX proteins appear to have a functional antagonism, thereby nullifying each other's function in inducing apoptosis (Figure 2).
# T19 Protein S12 47 50 1470 1473 p53
# T20 Protein S12 63 67 1486 1490 WWOX

Mutant p53 proteins cannot bind ectopic WWOX in GBM cells, and WWOX is able to induce apoptosis.
# T21 Protein S13 7 10 1622 1625 p53
# T22 Protein S13 40 44 1655 1659 WWOX
# T23 Protein S13 63 67 1678 1682 WWOX

Whether WWOX causes apoptosis in GBM expressing p53 isoforms is unknown and remains to be established.
# T24 Protein S14 8 12 1720 1724 WWOX
# T25 Protein S14 48 51 1760 1763 p53
