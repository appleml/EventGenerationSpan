In vivo intracellular GrB and IFNgamma staining of activated CD8+ T cells
# T1 Protein S1 22 25 22 25 GrB
# T2 Protein S1 61 64 61 64 CD8

Granzyme B (GrB) and IFNgamma expressing CD8+ T cells were determined by treating the mice intranasally with 50 microg Brefeldin A (Sigma) as previously described [86].
# T3 Protein S2 0 10 74 84 Granzyme B
# T4 Protein S2 12 15 86 89 GrB
# T5 Protein S2 41 44 115 118 CD8

6 h later, BAL and lungs were isolated and single cell suspensions were prepared from the lung in the presence of 3 microg/ml Brefeldin A. Cells were stained, fixed and permeabilized (Cytofix/Cytoperm, BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Activated CD8+ T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry based on CD62lo CD3+ and CD8+ expression.
# T6 Protein S4 10 13 517 520 CD8
# T7 Protein S4 71 74 578 581 CD3
# T8 Protein S4 80 83 587 590 CD8

Live/Dead fixable aqua dead cell stain kit (Molecular Probes) was used to discriminate live from dead cells.
