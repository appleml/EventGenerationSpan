TNF receptor-associated factor 1
# T1 Protein S1 0 32 0 32 TNF receptor-associated factor 1

TRAF1 is a unique member of the TRAF protein family because it lacks a RING finger domain and therefore lacks ubiquitin ligase activity.
# T2 Protein S2 0 5 33 38 TRAF1
# T3 Protein S2 110 119 143 152 ubiquitin

Accumulating data support a role for TRAF1 as both a negative and a positive modulator of NF-kappaB signalling by certain TNF family receptors, possibly in a cell-type-dependent manner [71,72].
# T4 Protein S3 37 42 207 212 TRAF1

Expression of TRAF1 is inducible by TNF and overexpression of TRAF1 inhibits TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation.
# T5 Protein S4 14 19 378 383 TRAF1
# T6 Protein S4 36 39 400 403 TNF
# T7 Protein S4 62 67 426 431 TRAF1
# T8 Protein S4 77 80 441 444 TNF

TRAF1-deficient T cells are hyper-responsive to TNF, with enhanced proliferation and activation of the NF-kappaB signalling pathway.
# T9 Protein S5 0 5 475 480 TRAF1
# T10 Protein S5 48 51 523 526 TNF

TRAF1 also functions as a negative regulator of CD40-induced NF-kappaB activation.
# T11 Protein S6 0 5 608 613 TRAF1
# T12 Protein S6 48 52 656 660 CD40

TRAF1-deficient dendritic cells, however, show attenuated responses to secondary stimulation by TRAF2-dependent factors, suggesting a positive regulatory role in these cells.
# T13 Protein S7 0 5 691 696 TRAF1
# T14 Protein S7 96 101 787 792 TRAF2

The mechanism by which TRAF1 modulates NF- kappaB activation is still unclear.
# T15 Protein S8 23 28 889 894 TRAF1

Most probably, TRAF1 competes with TRAF family members for binding to the receptor or other signalling proteins.
# T16 Protein S9 15 20 960 965 TRAF1

Alternatively, TRAF1 might recruit A20 with which it can physically interact [73].
# T17 Protein S10 15 20 1073 1078 TRAF1
# T18 Protein S10 35 38 1093 1096 A20

A genome-wide association study examining more than 300,000 SNPs among approximately 1,500 autoantibody-positive RA cases and 1,800 controls identified a genetic variation at the TRAF1-complement component 5 locus as an important RA risk locus [74].
# T19 Protein S11 179 184 1320 1325 TRAF1

Subsequent work indicates that TRAF1 is more likely to be the causative locus [75].
# T20 Protein S12 31 36 1422 1427 TRAF1

Recent work in a Korean population also demonstrates genetic association of the TRAF1 region with RA [76].
