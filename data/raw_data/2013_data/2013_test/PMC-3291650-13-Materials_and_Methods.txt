Flow cytometry

Lungs were dissected and incubated with collagenase type IV (1 mg/ml; Sigma) and DNAse (100 U/ml; Roche) at 37degreesC for 30 min.
# T1 Protein S2 40 59 55 74 collagenase type IV

Subsequently, samples were filtered through a 70 microm and 40 microm nylon mesh.

For the preparation of BAL, trachea were canulated and airway lumen was flushed 4 times with HBSS with 1 mM EDTA.

Cells were stained with monoclonal antibodies directed against MHC-II (I-A/I-E) FITC (M5/114.15.2), CD11c PerCP-Cy5.5 (N418), F4/80 APC (BM8), CD62L PE (MEL-14), Granzyme B FITC (NGZB) from eBiosciences and CD3 Molecular Complex Horizon v450 (17A2), Ly6C Horizon v450 (AL-21), Ly6G PE (1A8), CD11b APC-Cy7 (M1/70), CD8alpha PerCP (53-6.7), IFNgamma Alexa 647 (XMG1.2) and CD16/32 (2.4G2) from BD Pharmingen.

Samples were acquired on a LSRII Cytometer and analyzed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).

Propidium iodide was used to discriminate between live and dead cells.
