IL-17 production in PBMC from patients with RA, patients with OA and normal individuals
# T1 Protein S1 0 5 0 5 IL-17

PBMC were separated and cultured with PHA (5 mug/ml) from patients with RA, patients with OA, and age-matched normal controls; IL-17 levels were then determined in the culture supernatants (Fig. 1).
# T2 Protein S2 38 41 126 129 PHA
# T3 Protein S2 127 132 215 220 IL-17

Although the amounts of basal IL-17 secretion were not different between RA, OA and normal controls (62 +/- 31, 43 +/- 19 and 43 +/- 10 pg/ml, respectively), the IL-17 production stimulated by PHA was significantly higher in RA PBMC than in those from OA and controls (768 +/- 295 versus 463 +/- 211 pg/ml [P < 0.05] and 241 +/- 29 pg/ml [P < 0.001]).
# T4 Protein S3 30 35 317 322 IL-17
# T5 Protein S3 162 167 449 454 IL-17
# T6 Protein S3 193 196 480 483 PHA
