# T2 Protein S1 47 53 47 53 NFIL-6

Human PBMC were incubated with medium control or GP (1 and 100 mug) for 1 h at 37degreesC.

Nuclear extracts were incubated with a 32P-labeled NFAT, NFkappaB, NFIL-6 or NFkappaB-IL-8 oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-6 and IL-8 gene promoters (Table 1).
# T3 Protein S3 51 55 197 201 NFAT
# T4 Protein S3 67 73 213 219 NFIL-6
# T5 Protein S3 86 90 232 236 IL-8
# T6 Protein S3 134 142 280 288 IFNgamma
# T7 Protein S3 144 152 290 298 TNFalpha
# T8 Protein S3 154 158 300 304 IL-6
# T9 Protein S3 163 167 309 313 IL-8

Arrows with the black head indicate migrational location of the NFAT-DNA, NFkappaB-DNA, NFIL-6-DNA or NFkappaB-IL-8-DNA complex compared to free probe (no shift).
# T10 Protein S4 64 68 404 408 NFAT
# T11 Protein S4 88 94 428 434 NFIL-6
# T12 Protein S4 111 115 451 455 IL-8

Arrow with the open head indicates a supershift of NFkappaB-IL-8-DNA-anti-p65 and -p50, respectively.
# T13 Protein S5 60 64 563 567 IL-8
# T14 Protein S5 74 77 577 580 p65
# T15 Protein S5 83 86 586 589 p50

An autoradiogram from a representative experiment is shown (n = 7).

B, Decreased DNA binding of NFkappaB following GP + TSST-1, compared to TSST-1, GP, or TSST-1/GP.
# T16 Protein S7 52 58 725 731 TSST-1
# T17 Protein S7 72 78 745 751 TSST-1
# T18 Protein S7 87 93 760 766 TSST-1

Human PBMC were incubated with medium control, LPS, TSST-1, GP (100 mug), GP + TSST-1 and GP + LPS for 1 h at 37degreesC.
# T19 Protein S8 52 58 823 829 TSST-1

An autoradiogram from a representative experiment is shown.

Schematic representation of NFkappaB-DNA binding activity following GP (1 and 100 mug) or TSST-1 treatment (250 ng) as well as simultaneous administration of both compounds and the theoretical value (GP/TSST-1 calc.)
