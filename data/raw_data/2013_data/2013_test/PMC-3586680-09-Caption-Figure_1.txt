Schematic diagrams of WWOX structure and its role in signaling.
# T1 Protein S1 22 26 22 26 WWOX

WWOX contains two N-terminal WW domains, a C-terminal short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) domain, and a D3 region.
# T2 Protein S2 0 4 64 68 WWOX

A nuclear localization signal (NLS) is in between the WW domains (Chang et al., 2003, 2007; Del Mare et al., 2011; Salah et al., 2012; Su et al., 2012; reviews).

The SDR domain possesses a mitochondria-binding region.

There are two conserved tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Tyr33 and Tyr287.

Other phosphorylation sites predicted by NetPhos 2.0 Server are Tyr6, Thr12, Ser14, Tyr61, Tyr293, and Thr3B3, respectively.

Upon stress stimulation, WWOX is phosphorylated in Tyr33 and binds p53.
# T3 Protein S7 25 29 635 639 WWOX
# T4 Protein S7 67 70 677 680 p53

The WWOX/p53 complex then translocates to mitochondria or nucleus to induce apoptosis.

WWOX also binds PPxY motif-containing transcription factors, such as RUNX2, c-Jun, and ERBB4, via its first WW domain, and the binding blocks the activity of these proteins by retaining them in the cytoplasm.
# T5 Protein S9 0 4 769 773 WWOX
# T6 Protein S9 69 74 838 843 RUNX2
# T7 Protein S9 76 81 845 850 c-Jun
# T8 Protein S9 87 92 856 861 ERBB4

WWOX binds Tau via its SDR domain.
# T9 Protein S10 0 4 978 982 WWOX
# T10 Protein S10 11 14 989 992 Tau

WWOX participates in the Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway by binding Dvl and inhibiting its nuclear import.
# T11 Protein S11 0 4 1013 1017 WWOX

Phorbol ester stimulates the dissociation of MEK/WWOX complex in Jurkat T cell, and the released WWOX translocates to the mitochondria for causing cell death.
# T12 Protein S12 97 101 1217 1221 WWOX

WWOX is recruited to the membrane area by association with Hyal-2 and phospho-Ezrin.
# T13 Protein S13 0 4 1279 1283 WWOX
# T14 Protein S13 59 65 1338 1344 Hyal-2
# T15 Protein S13 78 83 1357 1362 Ezrin

Hyal-2 is an alternative receptor for TGF-beta1.
# T16 Protein S14 0 6 1364 1370 Hyal-2
# T17 Protein S14 38 47 1402 1411 TGF-beta1

In response to TGF-beta1, WWOX binds Hyal-2 and forms a complex, followed by relocating to the nucleus and enhancing the SMAD-driven promoter activity.
# T18 Protein S15 15 24 1428 1437 TGF-beta1
# T19 Protein S15 26 30 1439 1443 WWOX
# T20 Protein S15 37 43 1450 1456 Hyal-2

# T22 Protein S16 6 41 1571 1606 activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1
