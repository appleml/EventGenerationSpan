LPS induction of SerpinB2 mRNA and protein expression in murine macrophage cells.
# T1 Protein S1 17 25 17 25 SerpinB2

RAW264.7 macrophages were treated for the indicated times with 100 ng/ml LPS.

(A) qPCR analysis of murine SerpinB2 mRNA levels, relative to beta-actin.
# T2 Protein S3 28 36 188 196 SerpinB2
# T3 Protein S3 62 72 222 232 beta-actin

The plot is representative of at least two independent experiments performed in triplicate.

(B) Immunoblot analysis of SerpinB2 protein expression in whole cell lysates.
# T4 Protein S5 27 35 353 361 SerpinB2

Blot was reprobed for GAPDH as a loading control.
# T5 Protein S6 22 27 426 431 GAPDH
