MTb induces NFAT5 gene expression via the MyD88-dependent signaling cascade
# T1 Protein S1 12 17 12 17 NFAT5
# T2 Protein S1 42 47 42 47 MyD88

To begin to decipher the cellular mechanisms underlying NFAT5-dependent, MTb-induced HIV-1 replication, we next investigated the requirement for specific signaling molecules in the TLR pathway that are required for MTb stimulation of NFAT5 gene expression.
# T3 Protein S2 56 61 132 137 NFAT5
# T4 Protein S2 234 239 310 315 NFAT5

We began by examining the requirement of TLR2 ligation in enhancing NFAT5 mRNA levels.
# T5 Protein S3 41 45 374 378 TLR2
# T6 Protein S3 68 73 401 406 NFAT5

When THP-1 cells were treated with the TLR2-specific agonist Pam3Cys for 16 hours, NFAT5 mRNA levels were significantly increased in Pam3Cys-stimulated cells as compared to mock-stimulated control cells (Figure 7A).
# T7 Protein S4 39 43 459 463 TLR2
# T8 Protein S4 83 88 503 508 NFAT5

As a positive control for this experiment we also infected THP-1 cells with CDC1551 (Figure 7A).

Notably, MTb infection enhanced NFAT5 mRNA levels to a greater extent than Pam3Cys stimulation, suggesting that additional PRRs may be triggered during actual MTb infection, augmenting its stimulatory effect on NFAT5 gene expression (Figure 7A).
# T9 Protein S6 32 37 765 770 NFAT5
# T10 Protein S6 211 216 944 949 NFAT5

The adaptor molecule MyD88 transmits signals upon TLR2 ligation (reviewed in [53]).
# T11 Protein S7 21 26 1000 1005 MyD88
# T12 Protein S7 50 54 1029 1033 TLR2

To confirm that this protein and, therefore, that this TLR-dependent pathway is important for MTb induction of NFAT5 gene expression, we constructed a THP-1 cell line that constitutively expresses a lentivirally-delivered short hairpin (sh)RNA targeting MyD88.
# T13 Protein S8 111 116 1174 1179 NFAT5
# T14 Protein S8 222 243 1285 1306 short hairpin (sh)RNA
# T15 Protein S8 254 259 1317 1322 MyD88

Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that MyD88 mRNA levels in these cells were constitutively and significantly reduced in comparison to control THP-1 cells transduced with a lentivirus expressing control GFP shRNA (data not shown).
# T16 Protein S9 41 46 1365 1370 MyD88
# T17 Protein S9 205 214 1529 1538 GFP shRNA

These MyD88 knockdown THP-1 cells were then infected with MTb (CDC1551) and NFAT5 mRNA levels were examined.
# T18 Protein S10 6 11 1563 1568 MyD88
# T19 Protein S10 76 81 1633 1638 NFAT5

Since TNF is a MyD88-dependent gene [21], [54], [55], as a positive control we measured TNF mRNA levels.
# T20 Protein S11 6 9 1672 1675 TNF
# T21 Protein S11 15 20 1681 1686 MyD88
# T22 Protein S11 88 91 1754 1757 TNF

For a negative control, we measured mRNA levels of the MyD88-independent gene CD86 [55], [56].
# T23 Protein S12 55 60 1826 1831 MyD88
# T24 Protein S12 78 82 1849 1853 CD86

As shown in Figure 7B, knockdown of MyD88 specifically inhibited MTb-induced NFAT5 and TNF mRNA levels and had no impact on CD86 mRNA levels.
# T25 Protein S13 36 41 1902 1907 MyD88
# T26 Protein S13 77 82 1943 1948 NFAT5
# T27 Protein S13 87 90 1953 1956 TNF
# T28 Protein S13 124 128 1990 1994 CD86

Thus, MTb regulation of NFAT5 is dependent upon MyD88.
# T29 Protein S14 24 29 2032 2037 NFAT5
# T30 Protein S14 48 53 2056 2061 MyD88

To futher dissect the pathway mediating MTb upregulation of NFAT5 transcription, we also constructed THP-1 cells transduced with lentivirally-delivered shRNAs targeting IRAK1 or TRAF6, two signaling molecules downstream of MyD88.
# T31 Protein S15 60 65 2123 2128 NFAT5
# T32 Protein S15 169 174 2232 2237 IRAK1
# T33 Protein S15 178 183 2241 2246 TRAF6
# T34 Protein S15 223 228 2286 2291 MyD88

As shown in Figures 7C and 7D, knockdown of both IRAK1 and TRAF6 significantly inhibited MTb induced NFAT5 mRNA levels.
# T35 Protein S16 49 54 2342 2347 IRAK1
# T36 Protein S16 59 64 2352 2357 TRAF6
# T37 Protein S16 101 106 2394 2399 NFAT5

As expected, MTb-induced TNF gene expression was also significantly reduced (Figures 7C-7D), consistent with a role for IRAK1 and TRAF6 in TNF gene expression secondary to MTb infection as previously reported.
# T38 Protein S17 25 28 2438 2441 TNF
# T39 Protein S17 120 125 2533 2538 IRAK1
# T40 Protein S17 130 135 2543 2548 TRAF6
# T41 Protein S17 139 142 2552 2555 TNF

Although CD86 gene expression did not depend on MyD88 (Figure 7B), abrogation of IRAK1 and TRAF6 gene expression significantly reduced CD86 mRNA levels, indicating that CD86 expression is IRAK1- and TRAF6-dependent, but MyD88-independent in MTb-infected monocytes (Figures 7C-7D).
# T42 Protein S18 9 13 2632 2636 CD86
# T43 Protein S18 48 53 2671 2676 MyD88
# T44 Protein S18 81 86 2704 2709 IRAK1
# T45 Protein S18 91 96 2714 2719 TRAF6
# T46 Protein S18 135 139 2758 2762 CD86
# T47 Protein S18 169 173 2792 2796 CD86
# T48 Protein S18 188 193 2811 2816 IRAK1
# T49 Protein S18 199 204 2822 2827 TRAF6
# T50 Protein S18 220 225 2843 2848 MyD88

Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that MTb upregulation of NFAT5 gene expression in human monocytic cells requires activation of MyD88 and the MyD88-associated adaptor molecules IRAK1 and TRAF6.
