(A) L929 cells were treated with TNFalpha or zVAD.fmk under normal serum (10% FBS) or serum free conditions.
# T3 Protein S2 33 41 94 102 TNFalpha

Cell viability was determined after 24 hr using the CellTiter-Glo Viability assay.

The concentrations of all necroptosis-inducing agents are listed in the Materials and Methods section or indicated in the figures.

(B) Cells were treated with zVAD.fmk, the indicated growth factors, and Nec-1 under serum free conditions for 24 hrs followed by measurement of cell viability.

(C) Cells under serum free conditions were treated with FGF, zVAD.fmk, or both for 24 hrs followed by viability assay.

(D) Cell death was induced by zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha under full serum condition in the presence of 2 microM PD173074 and 20 microM PD166866.
# T4 Protein S7 42 50 705 713 TNFalpha

In all graphs, average+/-SD was plotted.
