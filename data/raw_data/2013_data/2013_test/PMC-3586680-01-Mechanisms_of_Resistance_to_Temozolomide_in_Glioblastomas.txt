Glioblastoma multiforme afflicts 12,500 new patients in the U.S. annually (Friedman et al., 2000; Stupp et al., 2009; Silber et al., 2012).

Glioblastoma (GBM) is highly lethal, and the average survival expectancy is 14.6 months, and the overall 5-year survival rate for GBM is only 9.8% (Friedman et al., 2000; Stupp et al., 2009).

High levels of resistance to current therapeutic modalities and cancer relapse are frequently seen in patients (Haar et al., 2012; Happold et al., 2012).

The current standard therapy for GBM mainly includes maximum debulking surgery, radiation, and treatment with the monofunctional alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) (Friedman et al., 2000; Nishikawa, 2010).

Multiple mechanisms are involved in the TMZ resistance, which may include cancer stem cells, microRNAs, drug efflux, DNA damage repair, tumor cells under hypoxia, histone deacetylation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, STAT3 kinase, and many others (Haar et al., 2012; Happold et al., 2012; Johannessen and Bjerkvig, 2012; Kitange et al., 2012; Kohsaka et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012b).

Temozolomide induces generation of DNA lesions, including O6-methylguanine, N3-methyladenine, and N7-methylguanine (Goellner et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012b).

The O6-methylguanine lesion is known to trigger autophagy, rather than apoptosis, to cause cell death (Kanzawa et al., 2003).

Also, inhibition of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 by a pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor (-)-gossypol leads to autophagic death in gliomas and enhances the action of TMZ (Voss et al., 2010).

# T2 Protein S8 49 54 1420 1425 Bcl-2

However, a recent study demonstrated that TMZ-induced autophagy is pro-survival, and may block the eventual apoptosis in GBM cells (Knizhnik et al., 2013).

Also, MAPO2 (C1orf201) gene participates in the O6-methylguanine lesion-induced apoptosis (Fujikane et al., 2012).
# T3 Protein S10 6 11 1700 1705 MAPO2
# T4 Protein S10 13 21 1707 1715 C1orf201

MAPO2 gene encodes a novel 37-kDa protein.
# T5 Protein S11 0 5 1809 1814 MAPO2

It is not determined whether this gene is involved in autophagy.

The O6-methylguanine lesion is a substrate for direct repair by O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) (Pollack et al., 2006; Hegi et al., 2008; Fukushima et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2012b).
# T6 Protein S13 64 102 1981 2019 O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase
# T7 Protein S13 104 108 2021 2025 MGMT

Without MGMT repair, O6-methylguanine initiates activation of mismatch repair-deficient (MMR) proteins or Rad3-related protein kinase that ultimately leads to apoptotic cell death (Caporali et al., 2004; Wang and Edelmann, 2006; Roos et al., 2007).
# T8 Protein S14 8 12 2123 2127 MGMT

High expression of MGMT or loss of MMR contributes significantly to TMZ resistance in many clinical cases (Pollack et al., 2006; Hegi et al., 2008; Sarkaria et al., 2008).
# T9 Protein S15 19 23 2383 2387 MGMT

The initiation of apoptotic signaling fails in the absence of the MMR system.

Sensitivity to TMZ is significantly associated with the methylation status of MGMT gene promoter in cells committed to differentiation (Villalva et al., 2012).
# T14 Protein S17 78 82 2692 2696 MGMT

An increase in MGMT gene promoter methylation, which blocks MGMT protein expression, prolongs cancer patient survival.
# T15 Protein S18 15 19 2789 2793 MGMT
# T16 Protein S18 60 64 2834 2838 MGMT

Intriguingly, overexpressed microRNA-21 reduces Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activity, thereby blocking TMZ-induced apoptosis (Shi et al., 2010).
# T17 Protein S19 28 39 2921 2932 microRNA-21
# T18 Protein S19 48 51 2941 2944 Bax
# T19 Protein S19 52 57 2945 2950 Bcl-2
# T20 Protein S19 68 77 2961 2970 caspase-3

MicroRNA-21 is considered as a pro-survival factor for cancer cells (Li et al., 2012).

Integrins play a role in the resistance of advanced cancers to radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

alpha5beta1 integrin negatively regulates p53 signaling, and the event induces glioma cell resistance to TMZ (Janouskova et al., 2012).
# T22 Protein S22 42 45 3263 3266 p53

alpha5beta1 integrin is considered as a therapeutic target for high-grade brain tumors.

The base excision repair enzyme alkylpurine-DNA-N-glycosylase (APNG), which repairs the cytotoxic lesions N3-methyladenine and N7-methylguanine, also participates in the TMZ resistance (Agnihotri et al., 2012).

Upregulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain coupling to suppress the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulated by cytochrome c oxidase contributes in part to TMZ resistance in gliomas (Oliva et al., 2011).

Reversal of TMZ resistance may be achieved by MGMT pseudosubstrates, O6-benzylguanine and lomeguatrib to sensitize tumors to TMZ (Zhang et al., 2012b).
# T23 Protein S26 46 50 3924 3928 MGMT

Methoxyamine-blocker of base excision repair contributes significantly to TMZ cytotoxicity particularly when O6-methylguanine adducts are repaired or tolerated (Goellner et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012b).

Dual targeting of base excision repair and NAD(+) biosynthesis may reverse TMZ resistance in patients with resistant and recurrent GBM (Goellner et al., 2011).

Interferon-beta (IFN-beta), levetiracetam (LEV), resveratrol, and valproic acid (VAP) increase the sensitivity of TMZ through MGMT-dependent or -independent mechanisms (Nakada et al., 2012).
# T24 Protein S29 0 15 4396 4411 Interferon-beta
# T25 Protein S29 17 25 4413 4421 IFN-beta
# T26 Protein S29 126 130 4522 4526 MGMT

Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol, reverses TMZ resistance via an NF-kappaB-dependent mechanism (Huang et al., 2012).

STAT3 inhibitor or STAT3 knockdown potentiates TMZ efficacy in resistant GBM cell lines (Kohsaka et al., 2012).
# T27 Protein S31 0 5 4705 4710 STAT3
# T28 Protein S31 19 24 4724 4729 STAT3

Intratumoral hypoxia is common in GBMs and may be associated with the development of TMZ resistance.

Induced hyperoxia can be utilized to reverse TMZ resistance in GBMs (Sun et al., 2012).

Cancer stem cells are probably the key to failure in TMZ treatment.

The concept of cancer stem cell survival from treatment with TMZ and other chemotherapeutic drugs has been more complicated than previously thought (Beier et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012).

CD133-positive cancer stem cells are expressed in both normal stem cells and cancer stem cells (Donovan and Pilkington, 2012).
# T29 Protein S36 0 5 5263 5268 CD133

However, the role of CD133 as a marker for glioma cancer stem cells relative to its biological function has yet to be established.
