Cytokine quantification

For TNF ELISA, 96-well plates were coated with TNF coating (TN3-19, eBioscience) and detection (R4-6A2, eBioscience) antibodies.
# T1 Protein S2 4 7 28 31 TNF
# T2 Protein S2 47 50 71 74 TNF

IFNalpha and IFNbeta protein levels were determined with an ELISA kit (PBL Biomedical Laboratories).
# T3 Protein S3 13 20 166 173 IFNbeta

For IFNgamma ELISA, 96-well plates were coated with IFNgamma coating (XMG1.2) and detection (R4-6A2) antibodies (eBiosciences).

Detection of MCP-1, KC, TNF, IL-1beta and IL-6 in BAL fluid was performed using Bioplex (BioRad) technology according to the manufacturer's instructions.
# T4 Protein S5 13 18 395 400 MCP-1
# T5 Protein S5 20 22 402 404 KC
# T6 Protein S5 24 27 406 409 TNF
# T7 Protein S5 29 37 411 419 IL-1beta
# T8 Protein S5 42 46 424 428 IL-6

Milliplex technology (Millipore) was used for the detection of MIP-2 in BAL fluid.
