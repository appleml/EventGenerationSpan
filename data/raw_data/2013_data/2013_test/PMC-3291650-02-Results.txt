A20 inhibits RIG-I-induced NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation
# T1 Protein S1 13 18 13 18 RIG-I
# T2 Protein S1 41 45 41 45 IRF3

RIG-I signaling induces the activation of NF-kappaB, IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors, which promote the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs that restrict further viral propagation.
# T3 Protein S2 0 5 57 62 RIG-I
# T4 Protein S2 53 57 110 114 IRF3
# T5 Protein S2 62 66 119 123 IRF7

Previous studies have shown that ectopically expressed A20 negatively regulates NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation upon RIG-I stimulation [50]-[52].
# T6 Protein S3 94 98 356 360 IRF3
# T7 Protein S3 115 120 377 382 RIG-I

Similarly, we show that A20 overexpression in HEK293T cells prevents NF-kappaB- and IRF3-dependent luciferase reporter gene activation induced by transfection of a truncated constitutive active form of RIG-I [53], corresponding to only the two N-terminal CARD domains of RIG-I [RIG-I (2CARD)] (figure 1A, left and middle graph).
# T8 Protein S4 84 88 490 494 IRF3
# T9 Protein S4 99 109 505 515 luciferase
# T10 Protein S4 164 198 570 604 truncated constitutive active form
# T11 Protein S4 202 207 608 613 RIG-I
# T12 Protein S4 271 276 677 682 RIG-I

We next investigated whether A20 also inhibits IRF7 activation.
# T13 Protein S5 47 51 782 786 IRF7

Unlike IRF3, IRF7 is not or weakly expressed under naive conditions and IRF7 protein levels are rapidly upregulated upon virus-induced IRF3 activation [54], [55].
# T14 Protein S6 7 11 806 810 IRF3
# T15 Protein S6 13 17 812 816 IRF7
# T16 Protein S6 72 76 871 875 IRF7
# T17 Protein S6 135 139 934 938 IRF3

To determine the effect of A20 on IRF7 activation, we therefore transfected minor amounts of an IRF7 expression plasmid together with plasmids encoding RIG-I (2CARD), A20 and an IRF7-specific IFNalpha4 luciferase reporter construct.
# T18 Protein S7 34 38 996 1000 IRF7
# T19 Protein S7 96 100 1058 1062 IRF7
# T20 Protein S7 178 182 1140 1144 IRF7
# T21 Protein S7 202 212 1164 1174 luciferase

RIG-I (2CARD) expression in the absence of IRF7 co-expression showed negligible IFNalpha4 promoter activation (grey bar, figure 1A, right graph), whereas significant reporter gene expression was observed in the presence of IRF7.
# T22 Protein S8 43 47 1238 1242 IRF7
# T23 Protein S8 223 227 1418 1422 IRF7

Similar to its inhibitory effect on NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation, A20 also prevented RIG-I-induced IRF7 activation (figure 1A, right graph).
# T24 Protein S9 50 54 1474 1478 IRF3
# T25 Protein S9 86 91 1510 1515 RIG-I
# T26 Protein S9 100 104 1524 1528 IRF7

These results demonstrate the potential of A20 to inhibit RIG-I-induced NF-kappaB and IRF3/7 activation.
# T27 Protein S10 58 63 1624 1629 RIG-I
# T28 Protein S10 86 90 1652 1656 IRF3
# T29 Protein S10 91 92 1657 1658 7

To study the effect of endogenously expressed A20 on RIG-I-induced signaling in a more immunological relevant context, we performed further experiments in A20 deficient primary macrophages.
# T30 Protein S11 53 58 1724 1729 RIG-I

Since A20 full knockout mice die prematurely as a result of severe multi-organ inflammation [37], we generated mice carrying a conditional A20 allele in which exon IV and exon V were flanked by two loxP sites [56].

Crossing these mice with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the lysozyme M promoter leads to specific deletion in myeloid cells and allowed us to generate myeloid cell specific A20 knockout mice [48].

To stimulate the RIG-I receptor, we transfected A20myel-KO BMDM and wild type control cells with minimal amounts of low molecular weight (LMW) poly(I:C), which is known to preferentially bind and activate RIG-I rather than MDA5 [57].
# T31 Protein S14 17 22 2319 2324 RIG-I
# T32 Protein S14 205 210 2507 2512 RIG-I
# T33 Protein S14 223 227 2525 2529 MDA5

Of note, this concentration of poly(I:C) was unable to induce significant TLR3 dependent NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation or cytokine production (data not shown).
# T34 Protein S15 74 78 2610 2614 TLR3
# T35 Protein S15 103 107 2639 2643 IRF3

As expected, poly(I:C) transfection induced the rapid expression of A20 in wild type, but not in A20myel-KO BMDM (figure 1B, upper panel).

At early time points, slightly slower migrating forms of A20 were observed, indicating that A20 undergoes a yet unknown modification upon poly(I:C) transfection.

Compared to wild type BMBM, A20 deficient cells showed enhanced NF-kappaB activation as indicated by increased phosphorylation and sustained degradation of IkappaBalpha (figure 1B).
# T36 Protein S18 156 168 3153 3165 IkappaBalpha

Furthermore, nuclear translocation of the p65 NF-kappaB subunit was enhanced in poly(I:C) transfected A20myel-KO BMDM, reaching a maximum at earlier time points compared to wild type cells (figure 1C).
# T37 Protein S19 42 45 3221 3224 p65

IRF3 is known to be activated upon phosphorylation of a series of carboxyl terminal serine residues by the IKK-like kinases TBK1 and IKKepsilon [58], leading to its dimerization and subsequent translocation to the nucleus [59].
# T38 Protein S20 0 4 3381 3385 IRF3
# T39 Protein S20 124 128 3505 3509 TBK1
# T40 Protein S20 133 143 3514 3524 IKKepsilon

Using immunoblotting with an antibody directed against phosphorylated Ser396, maximum IRF3 phosphorylation was detected at earlier time points in A20myel-KO BMDM compared to wild type BMDM (figure 1B).
# T41 Protein S21 86 90 3695 3699 IRF3

Similar to p65, IRF3 nuclear translocation reached its maximum at an earlier time point in A20 deficient BMDM compared to wild type cells (figure 1C).
# T42 Protein S22 11 14 3822 3825 p65
# T43 Protein S22 16 20 3827 3831 IRF3

NF-kappaB controls the expression of IL-6 and TNF, and NF-kappaB and IRF3 control the expression of IFNbeta.
# T44 Protein S23 37 41 3999 4003 IL-6
# T45 Protein S23 46 49 4008 4011 TNF
# T46 Protein S23 69 73 4031 4035 IRF3
# T47 Protein S23 100 107 4062 4069 IFNbeta

In line with the enhanced activation of NF-kappaB and IRF3 as described above, A20myel-KO BMDM secreted increased amounts of IL-6, TNF and IFNbeta (figure 1D).
# T48 Protein S24 54 58 4125 4129 IRF3
# T49 Protein S24 125 129 4196 4200 IL-6
# T50 Protein S24 131 134 4202 4205 TNF
# T51 Protein S24 139 146 4210 4217 IFNbeta

Similar results were obtained using peritoneal macrophages (data not shown).

Together, these results demonstrate that A20 plays an important role in the negative regulation of RIG-I-induced NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation in primary macrophages.
