Background

beta-1 to 3-D-glucans represent a pathogen-associated molecular pattern and are able to modify biological responses.

Employing a comprehensive methodological approach, the aim of our in vitro study was to elucidate novel molecular and cellular mechanisms of human peripheral blood immune cells mediated by a fungal beta-1 to 3-D-glucan, i.e. glucan phosphate, in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1).

# T5 Protein S4 320 326 615 621 TSST-1

Results

Despite an activation of nuclear factor (NF)kappaB, NFinterleukin(IL)-6 and NFAT similar to LPS or TSST-1, we observed no significant production of IL-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha or interferon gamma induced by glucan phosphate.

# T11 Protein S6 164 191 796 823 tumor necrosis factor alpha
# T12 Protein S6 195 211 827 843 interferon gamma

Glucan phosphate-treated leukocytes induced a substantial amount of IL-8 (peak at 18 h: 5000 pg/ml), likely due to binding of NFkappaB to a consensus site in the IL-8 promoter.

# T14 Protein S7 162 166 1035 1039 IL-8

An increase in IL-1receptor antagonist(RA) production (peak at 24 h: 12000 pg/ml) by glucan phosphate-treated cells positively correlated with IL-8 levels.

# T16 Protein S8 39 41 1089 1091 RA
# T17 Protein S8 143 147 1193 1197 IL-8

Glucan phosphate induced significant binding to a known NFIL-6 site and a new NFAT site within the IL-1RA promoter, which was confirmed by inhibition experiments.

When applied in combination with either LPS or TSST-1 at the same time points, we detected that glucan phosphate elevated the LPS- and the TSST-1-induced DNA binding of NFkappaB, NFIL-6 and NFAT, leading to a synergistic increase of IL-1RA.

# T23 Protein S10 233 239 1602 1608 IL-1RA

Further, glucan phosphate modulated the TSST-1-induced inflammatory response via reduction of IL-1beta and IL-6.

# T25 Protein S11 94 102 1704 1712 IL-1beta
# T26 Protein S11 107 111 1717 1721 IL-6

As a consequence, glucan phosphate shifted the TSST-1-induced IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype.

# T28 Protein S12 62 70 1785 1793 IL-1beta
# T29 Protein S12 71 77 1794 1800 IL-1RA

Subsequently, glucan phosphate decreased the TSST-1-induced, IL-1-dependent production of IL-2.

Conclusion

Thus, beta-1 to 3-D-glucans may induce beneficial effects in the presence of pro-inflammatory responses, downstream of receptor binding and signaling by switching a pro- to an anti-inflammatory IL-1RA-mediated reaction.

Our results also offer new insights into the complex regulation of the IL-1RA gene, which can be modulated by a beta-1 to 3-D-glucan.
