Akt contributes to necroptosis induced by zVAD.fmk and TNFalpha.
# T1 Protein S1 55 63 55 63 TNFalpha

(A,B) Necroptosis was induced by zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha (full serum, A) or growth factors/zVAD.
# T2 Protein S2 45 53 110 118 TNFalpha

fmk (serum free, B) in the presence of inhibitors of Akt (Akt inhibitor VIII), JNK (SP600125), p38 (PD169316), and Erk (UO126).

Cell viability was determined after 24 hrs.

(C) L929 cells transfected with Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 siRNAs for 72 hrs were treated with zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha for 9 hrs.
# T3 Protein S5 32 36 362 366 Akt1
# T4 Protein S5 38 42 368 372 Akt2
# T5 Protein S5 48 59 378 389 Akt3 siRNAs
# T6 Protein S5 101 109 431 439 TNFalpha

Cell viability and Akt expression levels were determined after 24 hrs.

In all graphs, average+/-SD was plotted.
