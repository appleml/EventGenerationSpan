Statistical analysis

The Kolmogorow-Smirnov test was used to evaluate, whether cytokine amounts and binding activities to transcription factors were normally distributed.

Correlation coefficients and corresponding significances were analyzed by the Pearson test (normal distribution) or the Spearman test (non-normal distribution).

To compare experimental data to a theoretical value (for example GP + TSST-1 vs GP/TSST-1 calc.)
# T1 Protein S4 70 76 402 408 TSST-1
# T2 Protein S4 83 89 415 421 TSST-1

we calculated the sum of the individual effects and added these values into Fig. 1B, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Significances of differences between experimental data (for example GP vs LPS) as well as between experimental data and theoretical values (for example GP + TSST-1 vs GP/TSST-1 calc.)
# T3 Protein S6 157 163 687 693 TSST-1
# T4 Protein S6 170 176 700 706 TSST-1

were analysed using the Student's t-test (normal distribution) or the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test (non-normal distribution), (SPSS for Windows; SPSS Science Software, Erkrath, Germany).
