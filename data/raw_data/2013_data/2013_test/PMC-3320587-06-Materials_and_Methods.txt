Quantitative DNase I footprinting
# T1 Protein S1 13 20 13 20 DNase I

Recombinant NFAT5 (amino acids 175-471) with an N-terminal 6x His tag was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Stratagene; www.stratagene.com) and purified under native conditions using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen).
# T2 Protein S2 12 17 46 51 NFAT5

Recombinant p50 and p65 were purchased (Active Motif, www.activemotif.com).
# T3 Protein S3 12 15 258 261 p50
# T4 Protein S3 20 23 266 269 p65

Quantitative DNase I footprinting was performed as previously described [31].
# T5 Protein S4 13 20 335 342 DNase I
