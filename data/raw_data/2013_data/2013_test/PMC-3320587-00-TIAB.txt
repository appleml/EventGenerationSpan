Regulation ofMycobacterium tuberculosis-Dependent HIV-1 Transcription Reveals a New Role for NFAT5 in the Toll-Like Receptor Pathway

Tuberculosis (TB) disease in HIV co-infected patients contributes to increased mortality by activating innate and adaptive immune signaling cascades that stimulate HIV-1 replication, leading to an increase in viral load.

Here, we demonstrate that silencing of the expression of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) by RNA interference (RNAi) inhibits Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb)-stimulated HIV-1 replication in co-infected macrophages.
# T2 Protein S3 82 119 436 473 nuclear factor of activated T cells 5
# T3 Protein S3 121 126 475 480 NFAT5

We show that NFAT5 gene and protein expression are strongly induced by MTb, which is a Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand, and that an intact NFAT5 binding site in the viral promoter of R5-tropic HIV-1 subtype B and subtype C molecular clones is required for efficent induction of HIV-1 replication by MTb.

Furthermore, silencing by RNAi of key components of the TLR pathway in human monocytes, including the downstream signaling molecules MyD88, IRAK1, and TRAF6, significantly inhibits MTb-induced NFAT5 gene expression.

# T6 Protein S5 140 145 1052 1057 IRAK1
# T7 Protein S5 151 156 1063 1068 TRAF6
# T8 Protein S5 193 198 1105 1110 NFAT5

Thus, the innate immune response to MTb infection induces NFAT5 gene and protein expression, and NFAT5 plays a crucial role in MTb regulation of HIV-1 replication via a direct interaction with the viral promoter.

# T10 Protein S6 97 102 1225 1230 NFAT5

These findings also demonstrate a general role for NFAT5 in TLR- and MTb-mediated control of gene expression.
