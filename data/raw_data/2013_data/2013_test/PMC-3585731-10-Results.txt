Akt Controls TNFalpha Production in Other Cell Types
# T1 Protein S1 13 21 13 21 TNFalpha

After establishing the role of RIP1 kinase-dependent signaling to Akt in L929 cells, we sought to expand our study to other cell types that are known to undergo necroptotic cell death.
# T2 Protein S2 31 35 84 88 RIP1

Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD)-deficient Jurkat T lymphocytes and the macrophage cell lines (J774A.1 and RAW264.7) are other models of necroptosis, which can be induced by stimulation with TNFalpha or zVAD.fmk, respectively [17].
# T3 Protein S3 0 40 238 278 Fas-associated protein with death domain
# T4 Protein S3 42 46 280 284 FADD
# T5 Protein S3 206 214 444 452 TNFalpha

Similar to L929 cells, a RIP1 kinase dependent increase in the phosphorylation of Thr308 on Akt occurred during necroptosis (Fig. 8B,D,F) in these cell types.
# T6 Protein S4 25 29 510 514 RIP1

Furthermore, TNFalpha mRNA levels were increased in each of these cell types during necroptosis and efficiently inhibited by both RIP1 and Akt inhibitors (Fig. 8A,C,E).
# T7 Protein S5 13 21 657 665 TNFalpha
# T8 Protein S5 130 134 774 778 RIP1

However, inhibition of Akt did not protect these cells from death (Fig.

S9A,B,C).

These results indicate that regulation of autocrine TNFalpha synthesis and necroptosis-associated inflammatory signaling may be a more important function of Akt pathway activation by RIP1 kinase in multiple cell types compared to its contribution to cell death.
# T9 Protein S8 52 60 947 955 TNFalpha
# T10 Protein S8 183 187 1078 1082 RIP1

We next chose to look at the role of Akt in necroptosis in mouse lung fibroblasts.

Lung fibroblasts selected to survive after deletion of all three Akt isoforms [40] were resistant to cell death induced by the addition of TNFalpha and zVAD.fmk.
# T11 Protein S10 139 147 1379 1387 TNFalpha

Expression of catalytically active Akt (Myr-Akt) in these cells restored TNFalpha mRNA production in response to TNFalpha and zVAD.fmk (Fig. 8G) without re-establishing cell death (Fig.
# T12 Protein S11 73 81 1475 1483 TNFalpha
# T13 Protein S11 113 121 1515 1523 TNFalpha

S9D).

Consistent with our earlier Akt knockdown data, lung fibroblasts expressing endogenous Akt1 or Akt2 were phosphorylated on Thr308 in response to TNFalpha and zVAD.fmk (Fig.
# T14 Protein S13 87 91 1681 1685 Akt1
# T15 Protein S13 95 99 1689 1693 Akt2
# T16 Protein S13 145 153 1739 1747 TNFalpha

S9E) and in both cases robust RIP1-dependent TNFalpha mRNA upregulation occurred under necroptotic conditions (Fig. 8H).
# T17 Protein S14 30 34 1797 1801 RIP1
# T18 Protein S14 45 53 1812 1820 TNFalpha

These data further support the notion that Akt activity is critical for autocrine TNFalpha synthesis, even in the absence of necroptotic cell death, indicating an unexpected differentiation between Akt-mediated inflammatory signaling under necroptotic conditions and cell death per se.
