The C/EBP family of basic leucine zipper transcription factors are known for their roles in cellular differentiation and inflammation [59].

Consisting of six members, the C/EBP transcription factors can homo-/heterodimerize and display similar DNA binding specificities [60].

Four family members, C/EBP-alpha, C/EBP-beta, C/EBP-delta and C/EBP-epsilon, are present in myeloid cells and play different roles in differentiating myeloid cells depending on the extracellular environment [61].

# T4 Protein S4 34 44 419 429 C/EBP-beta
# T5 Protein S4 46 57 431 442 C/EBP-delta
# T6 Protein S4 62 75 447 460 C/EBP-epsilon

To determine which C/EBP proteins were involved in the formation of the different nucleo-protein complexes, and particularly of the LPS-inducible complex, EMSA was performed after incubating the nucleo-protein complexes with antibodies specific for C/EBP-alpha, C/EBP-beta, C/EBP-delta and C/EBP-epsilon.

# T8 Protein S5 262 272 860 870 C/EBP-beta
# T9 Protein S5 274 285 872 883 C/EBP-delta
# T10 Protein S5 290 303 888 901 C/EBP-epsilon

Each antibody detects the carboxy-terminal DNA-binding region of the respective protein, so that pre-incubation of antibody with nuclear extract is expected to abolish DNA binding by EMSA [62].

Only antibodies against C/EBP-beta abolished the formation of the LPS-inducible complex (Fig. 5C).

Taken together these data show that the LPS-induced complex with the C/EBP element (-203/-192) contains C/EBP-beta.
