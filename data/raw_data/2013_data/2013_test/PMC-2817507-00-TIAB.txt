Activation of TLR4-Mediated NFkappaB Signaling in Hemorrhagic Brain in Rats
# T1 Protein S1 14 18 14 18 TLR4

Inflammation and immunity play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).

Toll-like receptor 4- (TLR4-) mediated nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkappaB) signaling plays critical roles in the activation and regulation of inflammatory responses in injured brain.
# T2 Protein S3 0 20 177 197 Toll-like receptor 4
# T3 Protein S3 23 27 200 204 TLR4

However, the involvement of TLR4-mediated NFkappaB signaling in the pathogenesis of ICH remains unknown.
# T4 Protein S4 28 32 386 390 TLR4

The present study was to evaluate the temporal profile of the expression of TLR4 and the activation of TLR4-mediated NFkappaB signaling in brain tissues of Wistar rats after ICH.
# T5 Protein S5 76 80 539 543 TLR4
# T6 Protein S5 103 107 566 570 TLR4

TLR4 mRNA and protein, the phosphorylation of inhibitors of kappa B (p-IkappaBalpha), and the activity of NFkappaB were examined in hemorrhagic cerebral tissue by Rt-PCR, Western blots, immunohistochemistry staining, and EMSA.
# T7 Protein S6 0 4 642 646 TLR4
# T8 Protein S6 46 67 688 709 inhibitors of kappa B
# T9 Protein S6 71 83 713 725 IkappaBalpha

Compared with saline control, the TLR4 mRNA and protein significantly increased starting at 6 hours after ICH, peaked on the 3rd day after ICH, and then decreased but still maintained at a higher level on the 7th day after ICH (P < .05).
# T10 Protein S7 34 38 903 907 TLR4

The level of p-IkappaBalpha and the activity of NFkappaB also increased in the brain after ICH compared with saline control.
# T11 Protein S8 15 27 1122 1134 IkappaBalpha

The present study firstly suggests that TLR4-mediated NFkappaB signaling participates in the pathogenesis of ICH, which may become a therapeutic target for ICH-induced brain damage.
