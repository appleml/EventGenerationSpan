Inhibition of Tumor Development in CCR5-/- Mice
# T1 Protein S1 35 39 35 39 CCR5

The effect of CCR5 in tumor development was investigated using CCR5+/+ and CCR5-/- mice.
# T2 Protein S2 14 18 62 66 CCR5
# T3 Protein S2 63 67 111 115 CCR5
# T4 Protein S2 75 79 123 127 CCR5

B16-F0 melanoma cells were inoculated subcutaneously into CCR5+/+ and CCR5-/- mice (n = 20).
# T5 Protein S3 58 62 195 199 CCR5
# T6 Protein S3 70 74 207 211 CCR5

Tumor growth was monitored for 31 days.

Tumor growth in the CCR5-/- mice was significantly lower than that in the CCR5+/+ mice.
# T7 Protein S5 20 24 290 294 CCR5
# T8 Protein S5 74 78 344 348 CCR5

The tumor growth in the CCR5-/- mice was reduced to 19.1%, whereas the tumor growth in the CCR5+/+ mice was only reduced to 24.3%, in both tumor weight (Figure 1A and 1B) and tumor volume, respectively (Figure 1A and 1C).
# T9 Protein S6 24 28 382 386 CCR5
# T10 Protein S6 91 95 449 453 CCR5

These results correlated with mice survival rates.

There was a significant difference in survival rates between CCR5-/- mice (75% of starting time) and CCR5+/+ mice (15%) at the end of the experiment (Figure 1D).
# T11 Protein S8 61 65 692 696 CCR5
# T12 Protein S8 101 105 732 736 CCR5

There was a significant difference in survival rates between CCR5-/- mice and CCR5+/+ mice.
# T13 Protein S9 61 65 854 858 CCR5
# T14 Protein S9 78 82 871 875 CCR5

At the end of the experiment, 75% of the CCR5-/- mice survived while only 15% of the CCR5+/+ mice survived.
# T15 Protein S10 41 45 926 930 CCR5
# T16 Protein S10 85 89 970 974 CCR5

Subcutaneous tumors were harvested from the sacrificed mice 31 days after inoculation.

The immunohistochemical analysis of tumor sections, stained with H&E and for proliferation antigen PCNA, revealed greater inhibition of tumor cell growth in CCR5-/- mice.
# T17 Protein S12 157 161 1237 1241 CCR5

The histologic findings after H&E staining indicated that the tumor tissues of the CCR5-/- mice, but not those of the CCR5+/+ mice, contained large areas of necrosis.
# T18 Protein S13 83 87 1334 1338 CCR5
# T19 Protein S13 118 122 1369 1373 CCR5

PCNA reactive cells were significantly reduced in the CCR5-/- mice (Figure 1E).
# T20 Protein S14 54 58 1472 1476 CCR5
