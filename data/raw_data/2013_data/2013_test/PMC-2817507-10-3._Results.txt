Expression of TLR4 Protein Increased in Brain Tissue after ICH
# T1 Protein S2 14 18 19 23 TLR4

To investigate the increased TLR4 at the protein level, the expression of TLR4 protein was measured in brain tissue by the method of Western Blots using specific antibodies for TLR4.
# T2 Protein S3 29 33 97 101 TLR4
# T3 Protein S3 74 78 142 146 TLR4
# T4 Protein S3 177 181 245 249 TLR4

Our results showed that a low level of TLR4 protein was detectable in the saline control group.
# T5 Protein S4 39 43 290 294 TLR4

The expression of TLR4 significantly increased starting from 6 hours after ICH (P < .05), peaked on the 3rd day after ICH, and then decreased but still maintained at a high level on the 7th day after ICH (P < .05, Figure 2).
# T6 Protein S5 18 22 365 369 TLR4

This observation of TLR4 protein was consistent with the temporal profile of the TLR4 mRNA after ICH.
# T7 Protein S6 20 24 592 596 TLR4
# T8 Protein S6 81 85 653 657 TLR4
