Decrease of NF-kappaB activity in tumor tissue of CCR5-/- mice.
# T1 Protein S1 50 54 50 54 CCR5

A, The DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB was determined in the nuclear extracts of the CCR5-/- mice and CCR5+/+ mice tumor tissues by EMSA described in material and methods.
# T2 Protein S2 87 91 151 155 CCR5
# T3 Protein S2 104 108 168 172 CCR5

B, Expression of p50 and p65 phosphorylation in nuclear extracts (NE), and IkappaB and IkappaB phosphorylation in the cytosol (CE) determined by Western blotting.
# T4 Protein S3 17 20 255 258 p50
# T5 Protein S3 25 28 263 266 p65

C, Immunolfluorescence analysis of p50 confirmed that the intensities of nuclear staining for p50 were decreased in the tumor tissues of CCR5-/- mice.
# T6 Protein S4 35 38 436 439 p50
# T7 Protein S4 94 97 495 498 p50
# T8 Protein S4 137 141 538 542 CCR5

Data are means +/- S.D. of four experimental animals.

* indicates significant difference from CCR5+/+ mice (p<0.05).
# T9 Protein S6 40 44 646 650 CCR5

Scale bar indicates 50 microm.
