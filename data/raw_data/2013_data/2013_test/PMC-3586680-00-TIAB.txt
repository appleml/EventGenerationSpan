Tumor Suppressor WWOX and p53 Alterations and Drug Resistance in Glioblastomas

Tumor suppressor p53 are frequently mutated in glioblastomas (GBMs) and appears to contribute, in part, to resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) and therapeutic drugs.

WW domain-containing oxidoreductase WWOX (FOR or WOX1) is a proapoptotic protein and is considered as a tumor suppressor.
# T4 Protein S3 0 35 242 277 WW domain-containing oxidoreductase
# T5 Protein S3 36 40 278 282 WWOX
# T6 Protein S3 42 45 284 287 FOR
# T7 Protein S3 49 53 291 295 WOX1

Loss of WWOX gene expression is frequently seen in malignant cancer cells due to promoter hypermethylation, genetic alterations, and translational blockade.
# T8 Protein S4 8 12 372 376 WWOX

Intriguingly, ectopic expression of wild type WWOX preferentially induces apoptosis in human glioblastoma cells harboring mutant p53.
# T9 Protein S5 46 50 567 571 WWOX
# T10 Protein S5 129 132 650 653 p53

WWOX is known to physically bind and stabilize wild type p53.
# T11 Protein S6 0 4 655 659 WWOX
# T12 Protein S6 57 60 712 715 p53

Here, we provide an overview for the updated knowledge in p53 and WWOX, and postulate potential scenarios that wild type and mutant p53, or isoforms, modulate the apoptotic function of WWOX.
# T13 Protein S7 58 61 775 778 p53
# T14 Protein S7 66 70 783 787 WWOX
# T15 Protein S7 132 135 849 852 p53
# T16 Protein S7 185 189 902 906 WWOX

We propose that triggering WWOX activation by therapeutic drugs under p53 functional deficiency is needed to overcome TMZ resistance and induce GBM cell death.
