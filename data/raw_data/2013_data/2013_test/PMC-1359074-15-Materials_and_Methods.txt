Nuclear protein extract and in vitro translation of Sox6.
# T1 Protein S1 52 56 52 56 Sox6

Nuclear extracts were prepared from MEL cells (2 x 107) using a kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, California, United States).

The Sox6 in vitro translation expression vector, tagged with c-Myc and HA, was described before [15].
# T2 Protein S3 4 8 183 187 Sox6
# T3 Protein S3 61 66 240 245 c-Myc
# T4 Protein S3 71 73 250 252 HA

The translation was performed in a reticulocyte lysate based in vitro translational system (TNT(R) Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation Systems, Promega).

A vector without the Sox6 coding sequence was also translated as a negative control.
# T5 Protein S5 21 25 460 464 Sox6
