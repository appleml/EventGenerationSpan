(A) L929 cells were treated with zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha for 9 hr, followed by western blotting with indicated antibodies.
# T2 Protein S2 45 53 118 126 TNFalpha

(B,C) L929 cells were treated with zVAD.fmk (B) or bFGF/zVAD.fmk (serum free conditions, C) and samples were collected at the indicated time points for western blot.
