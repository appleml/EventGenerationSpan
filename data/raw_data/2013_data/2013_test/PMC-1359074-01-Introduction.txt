Sry type HMG box (Sox6) is a member of the Sox transcription factor family characterized by the conserved high mobility group (HMG) domain, consisting of 79 amino acids involved in DNA recognition and binding [1].
# T1 Protein S1 0 3 0 3 Sry
# T2 Protein S1 18 22 18 22 Sox6

Sox transcription factors bind to the minor groove of DNA and cause a 70degrees-85degrees bend of the DNA that leads to local conformational changes [2,3], while most other transcription factors target the major groove of DNA [4].

Therefore, Sox proteins may perform part of their function as architectural proteins by organizing local chromatin structure and assembling other DNA-bound transcription factors into biologically active, sterically defined multiprotein complexes.

Sox6 has been reported to be able to act as either an activator or a repressor, depending on its interactors and its target promoter context [5,6].
# T3 Protein S4 0 4 692 696 Sox6

Intriguingly, Sox6 has also been shown to act as a general splicing factor that participates in pre-mRNA splicing [7].
# T4 Protein S5 14 18 854 858 Sox6

Depletion of Sox6 in HeLa cell extracts blocked splicing of multiple substrates, and expression of the HMG domain of either Sox6, Sox9, or Sry in the extracts restored splicing, indicating functional overlap of these proteins [7].
# T5 Protein S6 13 17 972 976 Sox6
# T6 Protein S6 124 128 1083 1087 Sox6
# T7 Protein S6 130 134 1089 1093 Sox9
# T8 Protein S6 139 142 1098 1101 Sry

Regardless of how Sox6 functions in regulating gene expression, previous studies have demonstrated that Sox6 is an important regulatory molecule that plays a role in the development of the central nervous system [8-11], cartilage [6,12,13], and muscle [14,15].
# T9 Protein S7 18 22 1208 1212 Sox6
# T10 Protein S7 104 108 1294 1298 Sox6

A Sox6-null mutant mouse (p100H) has previously been identified in our laboratory [14].
# T11 Protein S8 2 6 1453 1457 Sox6

Mice homozygous for p100H show delayed growth, develop myopathy and arterioventricular heart block, and die within 2 wk after birth [14].

The p100H mutant allele is associated with a Chromosome 7 inversion that disrupts both the p gene and the Sox6 gene (and no other gene within 50,000 nucleotides of the chromosomal breakpoints) [14].
# T12 Protein S10 91 92 1768 1769 p
# T13 Protein S10 106 110 1783 1787 Sox6

Because the p gene functions solely in pigmentation [16], the Sox6 transcription factor is implicated in all other phenotypes.
# T14 Protein S11 12 13 1888 1889 p
# T15 Protein S11 62 66 1938 1942 Sox6

Among the HMG box proteins distantly related to Sry (the first member identified of the Sox transcription factor family) that similarly bind to the minor groove and bend DNA, but without sequence specificity, are the ubiquitously expressed HMG1 and HMG2 proteins [17].
# T16 Protein S12 48 51 2051 2054 Sry
# T17 Protein S12 240 244 2243 2247 HMG1
# T18 Protein S12 249 253 2252 2256 HMG2

Modulation of DNA structure by these and other HMG proteins can mediate long-range enhancer function on both DNA and chromatin-assembled genes by bringing together distant regions of DNA and associated factors.

Specifically, HMG proteins have been shown to modulate beta-globin genes [18-21].

The mouse beta-globin genes epsilony, betah1, beta-major, and beta-minor are clustered on Chromosome 7 and they are highly homologous to their human counterparts in organizational structure and function [22].
# T19 Protein S15 28 36 2594 2602 epsilony
# T20 Protein S15 38 44 2604 2610 betah1
# T21 Protein S15 46 56 2612 2622 beta-major
# T22 Protein S15 62 72 2628 2638 beta-minor

High-level expression of these genes requires a regulatory element, the locus control region that is characterized by a set of nuclease hypersensitive sites spread over 25 kb located 5' of the epsilony gene [23].
# T23 Protein S16 193 201 2969 2977 epsilony

The beta-globin genes are expressed in a tissue- and development-specific fashion.

In mice, erythropoiesis originates in the embryonic yolk sac where primitive erythroid cells express epsilony and betah-1 globins [22].
# T24 Protein S18 101 109 3173 3181 epsilony
# T25 Protein S18 114 129 3186 3201 betah-1 globins

At 11.5 d post coitus (dpc), erythropoiesis shifts to the fetal liver where definitive erythroid cells express adult beta globins (beta major and minor) [22].
# T26 Protein S19 131 141 3339 3349 beta major
# T27 Protein S19 146 151 3354 3359 minor

The epsilony gene is silenced in definitive erythroid cells.
# T28 Protein S20 4 12 3371 3379 epsilony

The mechanism of silencing of its human counterpart, epsilon globin, has been studied extensively.
# T29 Protein S21 53 67 3481 3495 epsilon globin

In definitive erythropoiesis, epsilon is activated and silenced autonomously [24,25], although in primitive erythropoiesis epsilon also appears to be regulated competitively [26].
# T30 Protein S22 30 37 3557 3564 epsilon
# T31 Protein S22 123 130 3650 3657 epsilon

The gamma-globin to adult beta-globin switch is controlled by promoter competition for the LCR [24,25].
# T32 Protein S23 4 16 3711 3723 gamma-globin
# T33 Protein S23 26 37 3733 3744 beta-globin

All the elements responsible for silencing the epsilon globin gene are within the epsilon gene or in adjacent sequences [27], suggesting that silencing is primarily gene autonomous.
# T34 Protein S24 47 61 3858 3872 epsilon globin
# T35 Protein S24 82 89 3893 3900 epsilon

Using promoter deletion analyses in transgenic mouse models and cell transfection assays, multiple DNA elements important to the silencing process have been previously identified in both the proximal and the distal epsilon gene promoter [27].
# T36 Protein S25 215 222 4208 4215 epsilon

Their corresponding transcription factors, such as GATA-1, YY-1, COUP-TF, and DRED have been identified and shown to directly bind to these DNA elements (as part of protein complexes) to regulate epsilon silencing [27].
# T37 Protein S26 51 57 4287 4293 GATA-1
# T38 Protein S26 59 63 4295 4299 YY-1
# T39 Protein S26 65 72 4301 4308 COUP-TF
# T40 Protein S26 78 82 4314 4318 DRED
# T41 Protein S26 196 203 4432 4439 epsilon

Thus, it appears that the silencing of the epsilon gene involves a complicated network of multiple cis elements and transacting proteins.
# T42 Protein S27 43 50 4499 4506 epsilon

In addition to playing an important role in the development of the central nervous system [8-11], cartilage [6,12,13], and muscle [14,15], it was shown that Sox6 is upregulated in long-term hematopoiesis stem cells (LT-HSC) compared with multipotent progenitors of adult mouse bone marrow lineage [28].
# T43 Protein S28 157 161 4751 4755 Sox6

In this study, we describe that Sox6 also exerts pleiotropic effects on erythropoiesis.
# T44 Protein S29 32 36 4929 4933 Sox6

These effects include delayed maturation of erythrocytes (that normally enucleate prior to entering the bloodstream [27]) and higher expression of embryonic globin genes.

The most extreme effect is the persistence of high expression of the embryonic epsilony globin gene.
# T45 Protein S31 79 94 5235 5250 epsilony globin

Here we describe and characterize the effects of Sox6 on the epsilony globin gene.
# T46 Protein S32 49 53 5306 5310 Sox6
# T47 Protein S32 61 76 5318 5333 epsilony globin

We show that Sox6 binds to the proximal promoter of epsilony globin and represses its transcription.
# T48 Protein S33 13 17 5353 5357 Sox6
# T49 Protein S33 52 67 5392 5407 epsilony globin

In wild-type (WT) mice, Sox6 is not expressed in yolk sac blood islands, but is expressed in fetal liver, the opposite expression pattern of epsilony globin.
# T50 Protein S34 24 28 5465 5469 Sox6
# T51 Protein S34 141 156 5582 5597 epsilony globin

In the absence of Sox6, epsilony globin is ectopically expressed in the fetal liver, demonstrating that Sox6 functions in definitive erythropoiesis.
# T52 Protein S35 18 22 5617 5621 Sox6
# T53 Protein S35 24 39 5623 5638 epsilony globin
# T54 Protein S35 104 108 5703 5707 Sox6
