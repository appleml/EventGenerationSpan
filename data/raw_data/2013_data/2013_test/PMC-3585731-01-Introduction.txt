Necroptosis is a form of regulated cell death that displays all the major hallmarks of necrosis [1].

A growing number of studies have implicated necroptosis in a wide range of animal models of human disease, including brain, heart and retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury, acute pancreatitis, brain trauma, retinal detachment, and Huntington's disease [2], [3].

Importantly, several recent studies have linked necroptosis to models of inflammation including intestinal inflammation and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [4], [5], [6].

The discovery of a regulated form of necrotic death could uncover molecular targets amenable to pharmacological intervention for the treatment of various conditions.

A complex consisting of two related Ser/Thr kinases, RIP1 and RIP3, plays a critical role in the initiation of necroptosis in multiple systems [7], [8], [9].

# T2 Protein S5 62 66 775 779 RIP3

A recent genome wide siRNA screen for mediators of necroptosis induced by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk in mouse fibrosarcoma L929 cells, revealed a broad and diverse cellular network of 432 genes that may regulate this process [10].

These data provided important confirmation of the highly regulated nature of necroptosis and revealed the first insight into the full repertoire of mediators of this form of cell death.

However, the specific signaling pathways activated during necroptosis and their connections to RIP1 and RIP3 remain poorly understood.

# T4 Protein S8 104 108 1400 1404 RIP3

Several recent studies [10], [11], [12], [13], [14] have suggested that JNK kinase activation plays an important role during necroptosis in L929 cells downstream from RIP1 kinase.
# T5 Protein S9 167 171 1598 1602 RIP1

For example, the transcription factor c-Jun, a key cellular target of JNK activity, was one of the hits in the genome wide siRNA screen [10].
# T6 Protein S10 38 43 1649 1654 c-Jun

Activation of JNK in L929 cells has been linked to autocrine TNFalpha synthesis, activation of oxidative stress and induction of autophagy, all of which contribute to necroptosis.
# T7 Protein S11 61 69 1814 1822 TNFalpha

Importantly, RIP1 kinase dependent activation of JNK and TNFalpha production has recently been described to be independent of its role in necroptosis [15].
# T8 Protein S12 13 17 1946 1950 RIP1
# T9 Protein S12 57 65 1990 1998 TNFalpha

Curiously, Akt kinase, a key pro-survival molecule and a well-established inhibitor of apoptotic cell death, has also recently been linked to necroptosis in L929 cells [16], where insulin-dependent activation of Akt was suggested to promote necroptosis by suppressing autophagy.
# T10 Protein S13 180 187 2269 2276 insulin

This conclusion was unexpected, since several reports from different groups, including ours, have established that autophagy promotes, rather than suppresses, zVAD.fmk-induced necroptosis in L929 cells [11], [14], [17].

This raised the possibility that Akt controls more general mechanisms that contribute to the execution of necroptosis.

Furthermore, the key question of whether insulin-dependent Akt activity solely provides an environment conducive for necroptosis or if Akt activation is an intrinsic component of necroptosis signaling that is linked to RIP1 kinase has not been explored.
# T11 Protein S16 41 48 2748 2755 insulin
# T12 Protein S16 219 223 2926 2930 RIP1

In this study, we expanded these observations to delineate the specific contributions and molecular ordering of the Akt and JNK pathways downstream from RIP1 kinase during necroptosis.
# T13 Protein S17 153 157 3114 3118 RIP1

Our data reveal that Akt is activated through RIP1 kinase-dependent Thr308 phosphorylation during necroptosis in multiple cell types.
# T14 Protein S18 46 50 3192 3196 RIP1

Furthermore, we found that downstream Akt signaling through mTORC1 and S6 contributes to the activation of necroptosis and TNFalpha production.
# T15 Protein S19 71 73 3351 3353 S6
# T16 Protein S19 123 131 3403 3411 TNFalpha

We found that the Akt pathway serves as a critical link between RIP1 kinase and JNK activation in L929 cells.
# T17 Protein S20 64 68 3488 3492 RIP1

Further data suggested that in multiple other cell types including FADD deficient Jurkat cells, RAW and J774.1 macrophage cell lines, and mouse lung fibroblasts Akt provides a key link to TNFalpha production, but is dispensible for cell death per se.
# T18 Protein S21 67 71 3601 3605 FADD
# T19 Protein S21 188 196 3722 3730 TNFalpha

Overall, our results reveal a specific and novel role for the Akt pathway in regulated necrosis and necrosis-associated inflammatory signaling.
