The Akt Signaling Pathway Contributes to the Regulation of Necroptosis

We next determined whether the necroptosis-associated increase in Thr308 phosphorylation results in an increase in Akt kinase activity.

Under necroptotic conditions, we observed an increase in the phosphorylation of multiple known Akt substrates (Forkhead box class O (FoxO) proteins, GSK-3 kinases and mouse double minute 2 (MDM2)) as well as downstream molecules (p70 ribosomal protein S6 Kinase (p70S6K), S6) (Fig. 5A).
# T1 Protein S3 173 188 380 395 double minute 2
# T2 Protein S3 190 194 397 401 MDM2
# T3 Protein S3 230 261 437 468 p70 ribosomal protein S6 Kinase
# T4 Protein S3 263 269 470 476 p70S6K
# T5 Protein S3 272 274 479 481 S6

In some cases (FoxO1, FoxO4, MDM2), a robust increase was observed.
# T6 Protein S4 15 20 509 514 FoxO1
# T7 Protein S4 22 27 516 521 FoxO4
# T8 Protein S4 29 33 523 527 MDM2

In other cases (FoxO3a, GSK-3alpha/beta, p70S6K and its substrate S6), the changes were less pronounced (Fig. 5A).
# T9 Protein S5 16 22 578 584 FoxO3a
# T10 Protein S5 24 34 586 596 GSK-3alpha
# T11 Protein S5 35 39 597 601 beta
# T12 Protein S5 41 47 603 609 p70S6K
# T13 Protein S5 66 68 628 630 S6

The timing of the phosphorylation changes paralleled the increase in Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 5B, S5A, B).

In the case of pFoxO1 we occasionally observed a shift in migration rather than an increase in band intensity (e.g. comparing Fig. 5A and B), suggesting that phosphorylation events in addition to Thr24 take place during necroptosis.
# T14 Protein S7 15 21 800 806 pFoxO1

Notably, in all cases the necroptosis-associated increases in Akt substrates were abrogated by Nec-1 (Fig. 5A, Fig.

S5A, B).

Overall, these data suggested that a significant part of the "canonical" Akt signaling network is activated at the onset of necroptotic cell death in a RIP1 dependent fashion.
# T15 Protein S10 152 156 1295 1299 RIP1

Akt kinase is considered to be a pro-survival protein that inhibits apoptosis through the control of multiple effectors including mTORC1, GSK-3 and others [28].

An important question is whether these same molecules reverse their pro-survival roles during necroptosis.

We found that inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR co-factor Raptor [29], protected cells from necroptosis (Fig. 5C).
# T16 Protein S13 84 90 1671 1677 Raptor

Similarly, the direct mTOR kinase inhibitor Torin1 [30] and the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103 [31] also efficiently inhibited necroptosis (Fig. 5C).

Knockdown of mTOR using siRNA further validated the small-molecule inhibitor data indicating a role for mTOR in necroptosis by protecting cells from both zVAD.fmk and TNFalpha induced death (Fig. 5D).
# T17 Protein S15 167 175 2046 2054 TNFalpha

mTORC1 regulates translation through activation of p70S6 kinase and, subsequently, ribosomal protein S6 [32].
# T18 Protein S16 51 63 2131 2143 p70S6 kinase
# T19 Protein S16 101 103 2181 2183 S6

Notably, a genome-wide siRNA screen [10] suggested an important role for protein translation in necroptosis.

Consistently, we found that the small molecule inhibitor of p70S6K PF-4708671 [33] attenuated necroptosis at the concentrations required to block S6 phosphorylation (Fig.
# T20 Protein S18 60 66 2359 2365 p70S6K
# T21 Protein S18 146 148 2445 2447 S6

S5C, D).

Partial siRNA knockdown of S6 protein attenuated necroptosis as well (Fig.
# T22 Protein S20 27 29 2506 2508 S6

S5E), suggesting that translational control by p70S6K/S6 may play a role in necroptosis.
# T23 Protein S21 47 53 2601 2607 p70S6K
# T24 Protein S21 54 56 2608 2610 S6

Overall, while the full repertoire of Akt targets during necroptosis remains to be fully explored, our data provide evidence that the activity of an anti-apoptotic branch of Akt signaling can promote necroptosis.

RIP1 kinase, Akt, mTORC1 and JNK control the upregulation of TNFalpha accompanying necroptosis.
# T25 Protein S23 0 4 2856 2860 RIP1
# T26 Protein S23 61 69 2917 2925 TNFalpha

Hitomi et al. [10] have recently reported that the induction of necroptosis by zVAD.fmk in L929 cells is associated with increased synthesis of TNFalpha, which potentiates cell death.
# T27 Protein S24 144 152 3096 3104 TNFalpha

Therefore, we examined whether Akt and its effectors contribute to TNFalpha synthesis.
# T28 Protein S25 67 75 3203 3211 TNFalpha

Consistent with a RIP1-dependent increase in TNFalpha protein (Fig.
# T29 Protein S26 18 22 3241 3245 RIP1
# T30 Protein S26 45 53 3268 3276 TNFalpha

S6A, B), we found that TNFalpha mRNA levels increased during necroptosis in L929 cells in a RIP1 (Fig.
# T31 Protein S27 23 31 3314 3322 TNFalpha
# T32 Protein S27 92 96 3383 3387 RIP1

S6C.

Under serum free conditions, bFGF alone triggered some induction of TNFalpha mRNA, while its combination with zVAD.fmk (but not zVAD.fmk alone) caused a pronounced further increase (Fig. 6A).
# T33 Protein S29 29 33 3428 3432 bFGF
# T34 Protein S29 68 76 3467 3475 TNFalpha

Conversely, PDGF caused a modest upregulation of TNFalpha mRNA, which was not further increased in the presence of zVAD.fmk (Fig. 6A), demonstrating that activation of necroptosis is specifically accompanied by a marked increase in autocrine TNFalpha synthesis.
# T35 Protein S30 49 57 3640 3648 TNFalpha
# T36 Protein S30 242 250 3833 3841 TNFalpha

Further analysis suggested that both Akt and mTORC1 contribute to the upregulation of TNFalpha mRNA during necroptosis as both small-molecule inhibition and siRNA knockdown of Akt and mTOR reduced TNFalpha mRNA levels in necroptotic cells (Fig. 6B,C,D).
# T37 Protein S31 86 94 3939 3947 TNFalpha
# T38 Protein S31 197 205 4050 4058 TNFalpha

Notably, RIP1 and Akt inhibitors had no effect on the levels of TNFalpha mRNA in control cells or in the cells stimulated with bFGF alone (Fig. 6A,B, Fig.
# T39 Protein S32 9 13 4116 4120 RIP1
# T40 Protein S32 64 72 4171 4179 TNFalpha
# T41 Protein S32 127 131 4234 4238 bFGF

S6C), suggesting that these kinases specifically mediate necroptosis-dependent increase in TNFalpha synthesis.
# T42 Protein S33 91 99 4353 4361 TNFalpha
