Quantitative analyses of the effect of sTNFp55R infusion on NF-kappaB phosphorylation and SMI-71 expression.
# T1 Protein S1 40 47 40 47 TNFp55R

(A) Quantitative analysis of NF-kappaB phosphorylation 12 hr after SE (mean +/- S.E.M).

Significant differences from saline-infused animals, *p < 0.05.

(B) Quantitative analysis of SMI-71 expression 1 day after SE (mean +/- S.E.M).

Significant differences from saline-infused animals, *p < 0.05.

(C) Linear regression analysis between p65-Thr435 phosphorylation and SMI-71 in the PC following SE.
