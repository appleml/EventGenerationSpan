Cylindromatosis protein
# T1 Protein S1 0 15 0 15 Cylindromatosis

Cylindromatosis (CYLD) protein was originally identified as a tumour suppressor involved in familial cylindromatosis [63].
# T2 Protein S2 0 15 24 39 Cylindromatosis
# T3 Protein S2 17 21 41 45 CYLD

CYLD is also involved, however, in diverse physiological processes ranging from immunity and inflammation to cell cycle progression, spermatogenesis, and osteoclastogenesis (reviewed in [64]).
# T4 Protein S3 0 4 147 151 CYLD

CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates NF-kappaB signalling initiated by TNFR, RANK and T-cell receptor stimulation (reviewed in [64]) (Figure 1), by deubiquitina-ting several NF-kappaB signalling proteins including NEMO, TRAF2, TRAF6, TRAF7, RIP1 and TAK1.

# T6 Protein S4 10 33 350 373 deubiquitinating enzyme
# T7 Protein S4 100 104 440 444 RANK
# T8 Protein S4 237 241 577 581 NEMO
# T9 Protein S4 243 248 583 588 TRAF2
# T10 Protein S4 250 255 590 595 TRAF6
# T11 Protein S4 257 262 597 602 TRAF7
# T12 Protein S4 264 268 604 608 RIP1
# T13 Protein S4 273 277 613 617 TAK1

Many of these are also targeted by A20 and it is still not clear why the cell needs A20 as well as CYLD to control NF-kappaB activation.

# T15 Protein S5 84 87 703 706 A20
# T16 Protein S5 99 103 718 722 CYLD

As A20 is only expressed in many cell types upon stimulation, it has been suggested that this protein mainly regulates later phases of NF-kappaB signalling, whereas CYLD would regulate constitutive and early signalling.

# T18 Protein S6 165 169 921 925 CYLD

In addition, their relative activity might also be cell-type dependent [64].

Interestingly, CYLD has been shown to negatively regulate RANK signalling and osteoclastogenesis in mice [65].
# T19 Protein S8 15 19 1068 1072 CYLD
# T20 Protein S8 58 62 1111 1115 RANK

Mice with a genetic deficiency of CYLD have aberrant osteoclast differentiation and develop severe osteoporosis.
# T21 Protein S9 34 38 1198 1202 CYLD

Osteoclast precursors of these mice are hyper-responsive to RANKL-induced differentiation and produce more and larger osteoclasts.
# T22 Protein S10 60 65 1337 1342 RANKL

CYLD expression is markedly upregulated under conditions of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and is recruited to ubiquitinated TRAF6 via the ubiquitin-binding adaptor protein p62 (also known as sequestosome 1) [65], followed by the CYLD-mediated deubiquitination of TRAF6.
# T23 Protein S11 0 4 1408 1412 CYLD
# T24 Protein S11 60 65 1468 1473 RANKL
# T26 Protein S11 127 132 1535 1540 TRAF6
# T27 Protein S11 141 150 1549 1558 ubiquitin
# T28 Protein S11 175 178 1583 1586 p62
# T29 Protein S11 194 208 1602 1616 sequestosome 1
# T30 Protein S11 232 236 1640 1644 CYLD
# T31 Protein S11 266 271 1674 1679 TRAF6

In this context, it is worth mentioning that transgenic mice expressing a mutated form of p62 also display abnormal osteoclastogenesis and develop progressive bone loss [66].
# T32 Protein S12 90 93 1771 1774 p62

These findings suggest that CYLD-mediated inhibi-tion of RANK-induced NF-kappaB signalling plays a key role in the negative regulation of osteoclastogenesis and indicate CYLD as a potential genetic factor involved in the pathology of bone disorders such as RA.
