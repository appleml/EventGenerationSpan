In the present study, we found that tumor weight and volume were much smaller in the CCR5-/- mice compared to the CCR5+/+ mice inoculated with B16 melanoma cells (Figure 1A and 1B).
# T1 Protein S1 85 89 85 89 CCR5
# T2 Protein S1 114 118 114 118 CCR5

The tumor growth inhibition in the CCR5-/- mice was associated with the inhibition of constitutively activated NF-kappaB and elevation of IL-1Ra in the tumor tissue.
# T3 Protein S2 35 39 217 221 CCR5
# T4 Protein S2 138 144 320 326 IL-1Ra

This anti-tumor activity was also associated with decreased expression of NF-kappaB target anti-apoptotic, cell proliferative, and tumor promoting genes (Bcl-2 and C-IAP1) but with increased expression of their target apoptotic genes; cleaved caspase-3 and 9, and Bax (Figure 3A-D).
# T5 Protein S3 164 170 512 518 C-IAP1

In the tumor and the spleen, the number of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, CD57+ natural killer cells, and the levels of IL-1Ra were increased (Figure 4 and 5).
# T6 Protein S4 113 119 744 750 IL-1Ra

These findings suggest that melanoma growth was inhibited in the CCR5-/- mice, and that the elevation of IL-1Ra, accompanied with decreased NF-kappaB, is significant in the inhibition of melanoma growth in CCR5-/- mice.
# T7 Protein S5 65 69 849 853 CCR5
# T8 Protein S5 105 111 889 895 IL-1Ra
# T9 Protein S5 206 210 990 994 CCR5

NF-kappaB regulates the expression of over 200 genes that control the immune system, cancer cell growth and inflammation [39].

Because of its abilities to induce the expression of a large array of inflammatory mediators and its roles as core transcription factors in diverse immune responses, NF-kappaB has been recognized as a major factor responsible for cytokine-associated cancer development or anti-tumor immunity.

In the melanoma tumor tissues of the CCR5-/- mice, the expression of NF-kappaB target cell death genes (Bax, caspase-3 and 9) and the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB, were significantly inhibited, but the expression of cell death inhibitory NF-kappaB target genes, such as Bcl-2 and cIAP were enhanced.
# T10 Protein S8 37 41 1461 1465 CCR5

In addition, CCR5-/- prevented the phosphorylation of IkappaB, accompanied with the inhibition of the p50 and p65 translocation into the nucleus (Figure 2A-C).
# T11 Protein S9 13 17 1742 1746 CCR5
# T12 Protein S9 102 105 1831 1834 p50
# T13 Protein S9 110 113 1839 1842 p65

Many tumors, including melanoma, have increased levels of NF-kappaB [40], which is likely acting as a survival factor for melanoma growth.

Thus, the inhibitions of NF-kappaB activity and the expression of target genes are critical in the inhibition of tumor growth in CCR5-/- mice.
# T14 Protein S11 129 133 2157 2161 CCR5

Although the mechanism is not clear as to how CCR5-/- downregulates NF-kappaB, it is noteworthy that NF-kappaB is activated or inactivated by many cytokines.
# T15 Protein S12 46 50 2217 2221 CCR5

Numerous studies showed that cytokine affect tumor growth by regulating NF-kappaB.

Inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8, activate NF-kappaB pathways in tumor cells [41].
# T16 Protein S14 40 44 2452 2456 IL-6

The interleukin 10 (IL-10) is well known as an anti-tumor factor as well as an anti-inflammatory factor [42], [43].
# T17 Protein S15 4 18 2520 2534 interleukin 10
# T18 Protein S15 20 25 2536 2541 IL-10

IL-10 inhibits constitutively activated NF-kappaB both in vitro [44] and in vivo [45].
# T19 Protein S16 0 5 2632 2637 IL-10

Inhibition of NF-kappaB by the IL-10 contributes to the anti-tumor effects through the activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis in Colon26-bearing mice [43].
# T20 Protein S17 31 36 2750 2755 IL-10

Similarly, several studies have demonstrated the ability of IL-1Ra to abrogate the proinflammatory effects of IL-1 [46].
# T21 Protein S18 60 66 2934 2940 IL-1Ra

It has been reported that IL-1 induces the activation of NF-kappaB in several cancers, and increases cell cycle progression, and the suppression of apoptotic cell death leading to tumor promotion.

The results of various studies over the past 10 years indicate that the major function of IL-1Ra is to regulate the pleiotropic effects of IL-1 by competitively blocking its functions [47].
# T22 Protein S20 90 96 3282 3288 IL-1Ra

The ability of IL-1 to induce its own antagonist is of interest in understanding the regulation and dysregulation of IL-1 signaling in normal and diseased tissue.

Up-regulation of the receptor antagonist represents a mechanism for turning off IL-1 signaling and creating a temporary state of refractoriness.

The elevated expression of IL-1Ra, without any change of IL-1 in tumors, suggests that the IL-1-signaling system may be dysregulated by IL-1Ra in tumors.
# T23 Protein S23 27 33 3717 3723 IL-1Ra
# T24 Protein S23 136 142 3826 3832 IL-1Ra

IL-1Ra has been shown to inhibit tumor progression in prostate, breast, and skin cancer [14], [15], [16].

Intracellular IL-1Ra (icIL-1Ra) inhibits IL-6 and IL-8 production in Caco-2 cells by blocking NF-kappaB pathways [37].
# T25 Protein S25 0 20 3950 3970 Intracellular IL-1Ra
# T26 Protein S25 22 30 3972 3980 icIL-1Ra
# T27 Protein S25 41 45 3991 3995 IL-6

We found that the levels of IL-1Ra were significantly elevated in the tumor tissues of CCR5-/- mice inoculated with B16 melanoma cells.
# T28 Protein S26 28 34 4097 4103 IL-1Ra
# T29 Protein S26 87 91 4156 4160 CCR5

Taken together, these data indicate IL-1Ra could be critically involved in the tumor growth inhibition of CCR5-/- mice through the inactivation of NF-kappaB in the present study.
# T30 Protein S27 36 42 4241 4247 IL-1Ra
# T31 Protein S27 106 110 4311 4315 CCR5

CCR5 increases tumor growth in a local model and inhibits the efficacy of a dendrite cell vaccine in CCR5+/+ mice compared with CCR5-/- mice [10].
# T52 Protein S28 0 4 4384 4388 CCR5
# T53 Protein S28 101 105 4485 4489 CCR5
# T54 Protein S28 128 132 4512 4516 CCR5

Cheng J and Sung RS examined the effect of CCR5 on the immune response to adenovirus vectors and graft function in an islet transplant model.
# T55 Protein S29 43 47 4574 4578 CCR5

They found that CCR5 absence does not prevent the local immune response to adenovirus transduction [48].
# T56 Protein S30 16 20 4689 4693 CCR5

Additionally, Tan MC et al. suggested that disruption of CCR5/CCL5 signaling, either by reducing CCL5 production by tumor cells or by systemic administration of a CCR5 inhibitor (TAK-779), reduced Treg (regulatory T cells) migration to tumors so that tumors are smaller in control mice [9].
# T57 Protein S31 57 61 4835 4839 CCR5
# T58 Protein S31 62 66 4840 4844 CCL5
# T59 Protein S31 97 101 4875 4879 CCL5
# T60 Protein S31 163 167 4941 4945 CCR5

These data support the important premise that inhibition of tumor growth in CCR5-/- mice could be related with the inhibition of immune escape.
# T61 Protein S32 76 80 5145 5149 CCR5

Similar to this finding, we found that the CCR5+/+ mice injected with melanoma cells apparently have a lower number of cytotoxic T cells (CD8+positive T Lymphocytes cells) and natural killer cells (CD57 positive NK cells), as well as dendrite cells, in spleen tissues compared to those without melanoma cells.
# T62 Protein S33 43 47 5256 5260 CCR5

But the lymphocytes of the CCR5-/- mice did not decrease when injected with melanoma cells.
# T63 Protein S34 27 31 5550 5554 CCR5

These differences of the immune response between the CCR5+/+ mice and the CCR5-/- mice, involving tumor immune tolerance, may be connected with the inhibition of cancer progression.
# T64 Protein S35 53 57 5668 5672 CCR5
# T65 Protein S35 74 78 5689 5693 CCR5

Taken together, in the cytokine array experiment, the level of MIP-1alpha (which has a potent activity of T cell and B cell migration) was increased in the CCR5-/- mice compared with those in the CCR5+/+ mice.
# T66 Protein S36 63 73 5860 5870 MIP-1alpha
# T67 Protein S36 156 160 5953 5957 CCR5
# T68 Protein S36 196 200 5993 5997 CCR5

Thus, relatively increased tumor associated cytotoxic lymphocytes could play an important role in inhibiting the tumor growth in CCR5-/- mice.
# T69 Protein S37 129 133 6136 6140 CCR5

Activation of NF-kappaB could modulate subcellular localization of NK cells and pathogenesis [49].

Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity prevented NK cell depletion, and thus increased anti-tumor activity by decreasing IL-6 production [50].
# T70 Protein S39 115 119 6364 6368 IL-6

Thus, the decreased NF-kappaB and elevated IL-1Ra could also be associated in the infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes into tumor, resulting in tumor growth inhibition.
# T71 Protein S40 43 49 6429 6435 IL-1Ra

In contrast, IL-23, a tumor growth promoting cytokine, increased NF-kappaB and immune cell infiltration in oral tumor [51].

These data indicate that NF-kappaB could be involved in the cytokine mediated anti-tumor activities of immune cells.

It is also noteworthy that IL-1Ra inhibited melanoma tumor growth by increasing the number of myeloid suppressor cells in tumor [25].
# T72 Protein S43 27 33 6824 6830 IL-1Ra

The 3-methylcholatrene-induced tumor incidence was reduced in IL-1alpha knockout mice, but increased in IL-1Ra mice with concomitant maturation of NK cells and anti-tumor immunity [52].
# T73 Protein S44 62 71 6993 7002 IL-1alpha
# T74 Protein S44 104 110 7035 7041 IL-1Ra

These data indicate that the decrease of NF-kappaB, and thus increase of IL-1Ra could be significant in tumor growth inhibition of CCR5-/- mice.
# T75 Protein S45 73 79 7190 7196 IL-1Ra
# T76 Protein S45 131 135 7248 7252 CCR5

Our data thus show significant clinical implications of CCR5, because CCR5 is a G protein-coupled receptor and it is amenable to use as a small molecule for the inhibition of CCR5.
# T77 Protein S46 56 60 7318 7322 CCR5
# T78 Protein S46 70 74 7332 7336 CCR5
# T79 Protein S46 175 179 7437 7441 CCR5

Several such compounds have already been shown to be safe in clinical trials for use in certain diseases such as HIV [53].

Thus, we believe CCR5 is a cancer target that warrants continued investigation.
# T80 Protein S48 17 21 7583 7587 CCR5

In summary, this study showed that melanoma cells growth was inhibited via modulation of NF-kappaB/IL-1Ra pathways in CCR5-/- mice.
# T81 Protein S49 99 105 7745 7751 IL-1Ra
# T82 Protein S49 118 122 7764 7768 CCR5
