Defective IL-10-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation in RA CD4+ T cells
# T1 Protein S1 10 15 10 15 IL-10
# T2 Protein S1 25 30 25 30 STAT3
# T3 Protein S1 53 56 53 56 CD4

The interaction of IL-10R with IL-10 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the latent transcription factors STAT1 and STAT3 [3].
# T4 Protein S2 19 25 85 91 IL-10R
# T5 Protein S2 31 36 97 102 IL-10
# T6 Protein S2 121 126 187 192 STAT1
# T7 Protein S2 131 136 197 202 STAT3

Macrophage-specific STAT3-deficient mice demonstrated that STAT3 plays a dominant role in IL-10-mediated anti-inflammatory responses [5], which has recently been confirmed in human macrophages by studies of dominant-negative STAT3 overexpression [30].
# T8 Protein S3 20 25 228 233 STAT3
# T9 Protein S3 59 64 267 272 STAT3
# T10 Protein S3 90 95 298 303 IL-10
# T11 Protein S3 225 230 433 438 STAT3

The induction of STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation by IL-10 in PB CD4+ T cells from active RA patients and from healthy controls was examined using western blotting.
# T12 Protein S4 17 22 477 482 STAT1
# T13 Protein S4 27 32 487 492 STAT3
# T14 Protein S4 52 57 512 517 IL-10
# T15 Protein S4 64 67 524 527 CD4

STAT3 phosphorylation was dose-dependently induced after IL-10 activation for 20 min in normal CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4a,4b).
# T16 Protein S5 0 5 624 629 STAT3
# T17 Protein S5 57 62 681 686 IL-10
# T18 Protein S5 95 98 719 722 CD4

In contrast, STAT3 was phosphorylated in freshly isolated PB CD4+ cells from RA patients and this STAT3 phosphorylation was detectable for up to 6 hours.
# T19 Protein S6 13 18 759 764 STAT3
# T20 Protein S6 61 64 807 810 CD4
# T21 Protein S6 98 103 844 849 STAT3

STAT3 phosphorylation was augmented only when activated by as much as 10 ng/ml IL-10.
# T22 Protein S7 0 5 900 905 STAT3
# T23 Protein S7 79 84 979 984 IL-10

Both sustained STAT3 phosphorylation and defective IL-10-induced STAT3 phosphorylation were found in RA ST CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4c).
# T24 Protein S8 15 20 1001 1006 STAT3
# T25 Protein S8 51 56 1037 1042 IL-10
# T26 Protein S8 65 70 1051 1056 STAT3
# T27 Protein S8 107 110 1093 1096 CD4

On the other hand, IL-10-induced STAT1 phosphorylation was not detected in either RA CD4+ T cells or normal CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4a).
# T28 Protein S9 19 24 1136 1141 IL-10
# T29 Protein S9 33 38 1150 1155 STAT1
# T30 Protein S9 85 88 1202 1205 CD4
# T31 Protein S9 108 111 1225 1228 CD4

These results indicate that STAT3 is the major IL-10-activated STAT in CD4+ T cells, and IL-10-induced STAT3 activation may be diminished in active RA, in association with sustained STAT3 phosphorylation.
