The MyD88-mediated signaling cascade is important for MTb induction of NFAT5 expression in human monocytes.
# T1 Protein S1 4 9 4 9 MyD88
# T2 Protein S1 71 76 71 76 NFAT5

(A) Engagement of TLR2 significantly enhances NFAT5 mRNA synthesis in monocytes.
# T3 Protein S2 18 22 126 130 TLR2
# T4 Protein S2 46 51 154 159 NFAT5

THP-1 cells were incubated with the TLR2-specific ligand Pam3Cys (5 microg/ml), infected with MTb strain CDC1551 (1:1 cells:bacilli), or left untreated.
# T5 Protein S3 36 40 225 229 TLR2

After 16 hours, NFAT5 mRNA levels were measured.
# T6 Protein S4 16 21 358 363 NFAT5

NFAT5 mRNA expression was significantly increased when the cells were incubated with Pam3Cys (*, p<0.05) or infected with MTb (**, p<0.01).
# T7 Protein S5 0 5 391 396 NFAT5

(B) MyD88 is important for MTb induction of NFAT5 gene expression in human monocytes.
# T8 Protein S6 4 9 535 540 MyD88
# T9 Protein S6 44 49 575 580 NFAT5

THP-1 cells that constitutively express lentivirally-delivered shRNA targeting MyD88 or control shRNA targeting GFP were constructed as described in Materials and Methods.
# T10 Protein S7 79 84 696 701 MyD88
# T11 Protein S7 112 115 729 732 GFP

Cells were infected with MTb strain CDC1551 (1:1 cells:bacilli) or left uninfected for 16 hours at 37degreesC, and RNA was analyzed.

NFAT5 mRNA levels were significantly inhibited in the cells transduced with MyD88-specific shRNA (black bars) compared with the cells transduced with control shRNA (open bars) in both, the absence or presence of MTb infection.
# T12 Protein S9 0 5 922 927 NFAT5
# T13 Protein S9 76 81 998 1003 MyD88

TNF and CD86 mRNAs, the expression of which are MyD88-dependent and -independent, respectively, during MTb infection, were measured as controls.
# T14 Protein S10 0 3 1149 1152 TNF
# T15 Protein S10 8 12 1157 1161 CD86
# T16 Protein S10 48 53 1197 1202 MyD88

(C, D) IRAK1 and TRAF6 are required for MTb induction of NFAT5 gene expression in human monocytes.
# T17 Protein S11 7 12 1301 1306 IRAK1
# T18 Protein S11 17 22 1311 1316 TRAF6
# T19 Protein S11 57 62 1351 1356 NFAT5

THP-1 cells that constitutively express lentivirally-delivered IRAK1- or TRAF6-specific shRNA were constructed as described in Materials and Methods.
# T20 Protein S12 63 68 1456 1461 IRAK1
# T21 Protein S12 73 78 1466 1471 TRAF6

THP-1 cells expressing control shRNA were used as described in 7B.
# T22 Protein S13 31 36 1574 1579 shRNA

Cells were infected with MTb strain CDC1551 or left uninfected for 16 hours at 37degreesC, and RNA was analyzed.

NFAT5 expression was significantly inhibited in the MTb-infected cells expressing either IRAK1 (C) or TRAF6 (D) shRNA (black bars) compared to cells expressing control shRNA (open bars).
# T23 Protein S15 0 5 1723 1728 NFAT5
# T24 Protein S15 89 94 1812 1817 IRAK1
# T25 Protein S15 102 107 1825 1830 TRAF6
# T26 Protein S15 168 173 1891 1896 shRNA

TNF and CD86 mRNAs, both of which require IRAK1 and TRAF6 to be induced by PRR activation, were measured as controls.
# T27 Protein S16 0 3 1910 1913 TNF
# T28 Protein S16 8 12 1918 1922 CD86
# T29 Protein S16 42 47 1952 1957 IRAK1
# T30 Protein S16 52 57 1962 1967 TRAF6
