Expression of Proinflammatory Cytokines Was Elevated in Nrf2 Knockout Astrocytes after Scratch Injury

As we all know, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 are regulated by NF-kappaB and reflect the endogenous activity of NF-kappaB.
# T1 Protein S3 27 35 134 142 IL-1beta
# T2 Protein S3 41 45 148 152 IL-6

It has been revealed that these proinflammatory cytokines are increased after TBI in animals [2, 8].

And our previous study has proved that higher levels of such proinflammatory cytokines were observed in the brain of Nrf2-deficient mice after TBI [5].

But it is still ambiguous about the relationship between these cytokines and Nrf2 in astrocytes after TBI.

Here, we tested the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in cultured astrocytes at 24 h after scratch injury by RT-PCR and ELISA.
# T3 Protein S7 41 49 631 639 IL-1beta
# T4 Protein S7 55 59 645 649 IL-6

It was shown that the mRNA levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 were increased after scratch in both WT and KO astrocytes when compared with their sham counterparts, respectively.
# T5 Protein S8 48 56 771 779 IL-1beta
# T6 Protein S8 62 66 785 789 IL-6

Moreover, the mRNA levels of these cytokines in group KO TBI were much higher than those in group WT TBI (1.66 +/- 0.085 versus 1.39 +/- 0.110 for TNF-alpha, 1.34 +/- 0.064 versus 0.73 +/- 0.088 for IL-1beta, and 1.28 +/- 0.102 versus 0.99 +/- 0.073 for IL-6.
# T7 Protein S9 199 207 1105 1113 IL-1beta
# T8 Protein S9 254 258 1160 1164 IL-6

P < 0.01) (Figures 3(a)-3(d)).

The results of ELISA revealed that the protein level of TNF-alpha was upregulated after scratch injury in WT and KO astrocytes when compared with their sham counterparts.

And it was also higher in group KO TBI than in group WT TBI (3.67 +/- 0.156 versus 2.31 +/- 0.087, P < 0.01) (Figure 4(a)).

Similar tendency was observed in protein level of IL-6 and IL-1beta.
# T9 Protein S13 50 54 1542 1546 IL-6
# T10 Protein S13 59 67 1551 1559 IL-1beta

For IL-6, it was 36.07 +/- 0.786 for group KO TBI while 25.76 +/- 0.536 for group WT TBI (P < 0.01) (Figure 4(b)).
# T11 Protein S14 4 8 1565 1569 IL-6

For IL-1beta, it was 190.75 +/- 6.339 for group KO TBI while 154.50 +/- 5.348 for group WT TBI (P < 0.01) (Figure 4(c)).
# T12 Protein S15 4 12 1680 1688 IL-1beta
