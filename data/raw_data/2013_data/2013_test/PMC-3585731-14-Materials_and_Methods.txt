DNA

Cloning of Myr-Akt1, containing c-terminal FLAG tag, has been described [52].
# T1 Protein S2 11 19 15 23 Myr-Akt1

Myr-Akt1-FLAG was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the BglII and EcoRI sites of pMSCV-puro retroviral vector (Invitrogen).
# T2 Protein S3 0 13 82 95 Myr-Akt1-FLAG

Mutant versions of Myr-Akt1 were generated using the same strategy.
# T3 Protein S4 19 27 227 235 Myr-Akt1
