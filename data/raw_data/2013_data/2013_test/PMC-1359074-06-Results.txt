The Expression Pattern of Sox6 Suggests a Role in Definitive Erythropoiesis
# T1 Protein S1 26 30 26 30 Sox6

The observation that Sox6-deficient mice ectopically express epsilony globin in liver, where definitive erythroid cells mature, suggests that Sox6 is an important regulator in definitive erythropoiesis.
# T2 Protein S2 21 25 97 101 Sox6
# T3 Protein S2 61 76 137 152 epsilony globin
# T4 Protein S2 142 146 218 222 Sox6

To determine the temporal and spatial expression pattern of Sox6, Northern blot and in situ hybridization assays were employed.
# T5 Protein S3 60 64 339 343 Sox6

As shown in Figure 6A, Sox6 is detectable by Northern blot beginning at 10.5 dpc, coincident with the temporal onset of definitive erythropoiesis in the liver.
# T6 Protein S4 23 27 430 434 Sox6

Furthermore, in situ hybridization shows that Sox6 is highly transcribed in 12.5-dpc liver, but not in yolk sac blood islands at 7.5 dpc (Figure 6B).
# T7 Protein S5 46 50 613 617 Sox6

Therefore, Sox6 expression is temporally and spatially coincident with definitive, but not primitive, erythropoiesis.
# T8 Protein S6 11 15 728 732 Sox6

These data, taken together with the observation that epsilony globin is highly expressed in the liver cells of 14.5-dpc p100H mutant mice (Figure 5), demonstrate that Sox6 functions in definitive erythropoiesis.
# T9 Protein S7 53 68 888 903 epsilony globin
# T10 Protein S7 167 171 1002 1006 Sox6
