Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays (MEF Cells)
# T1 Protein S1 27 37 27 37 Luciferase

Cebpb-/- MEFs (1x105) [34] were transfected with the indicated luciferase reporter plasmid (400 ng) along with a beta-actin-beta-galactosidase reporter plasmid (200 ng) by electroporation using the Invitrogen Neon(TM) system (1 pulse, 1350 V, 30 msec).
# T2 Protein S2 0 5 57 62 Cebpb
# T3 Protein S2 63 73 120 130 luciferase
# T4 Protein S2 113 123 170 180 beta-actin
# T5 Protein S2 124 142 181 199 beta-galactosidase

Transfected cells were transferred to pre-warmed media in 24 well plates and incubated for 48 hrs prior to incubation with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 hrs where indicated.

In some experiments, plasmids encoding C/EBP-beta or C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor mutants (T188A, T217A, S64A) [38]-[40] or control vector were co-transfected (0.6-1.0 microg total DNA).
# T6 Protein S4 39 49 515 525 C/EBP-beta
# T7 Protein S4 53 88 529 564 C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor mutants
# T8 Protein S4 90 95 566 571 T188A
# T9 Protein S4 97 102 573 578 T217A
# T10 Protein S4 104 108 580 584 S64A

Luciferase activity was determined and normalized to that of beta-galactosidase [38] using the Luciferase Assay System and beta-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System Kits, respectively (Promega).
# T11 Protein S5 0 10 662 672 Luciferase
# T12 Protein S5 61 79 723 741 beta-galactosidase
# T13 Protein S5 95 105 757 767 Luciferase
# T14 Protein S5 123 141 785 803 beta-Galactosidase

Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and triplicate samples were employed for each sample.

Expression of the C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor mutant proteins was checked for equal expression by western blot.
# T15 Protein S7 18 52 977 1011 C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor mutant
