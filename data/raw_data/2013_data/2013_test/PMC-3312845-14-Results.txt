NF-kappaB phosphorylation

It is well established that TNF-alpha is one of the major stimuli toward phosphorylation of NF-kappaB.

To confirm TNF-alpha-mediated signaling following SE, we performed an immunohistochemical study using five phospho-NF-kappaB antibodies.
# T2 Protein S3 11 20 140 149 TNF-alpha

Compared to non-SE animals (data not shown), 12 hr-post SE animals of the saline-infused group showed p65-Ser276, p65-Ser311, p65-Ser529, and p65-Ser536 phosphorylation in astrocytes (not endothelial cells).
# T3 Protein S4 102 105 368 371 p65
# T4 Protein S4 114 117 380 383 p65
# T5 Protein S4 126 129 392 395 p65
# T6 Protein S4 142 145 408 411 p65

sTNFp55R infusion effectively reduced p65-Ser276 and p65-Ser311 phosphorylation (p < 0.05, respectively), while it could not affect p65-Ser529 or p65-Ser536 phosphorylation (Figures 3 and 4A).
# T7 Protein S5 1 8 475 482 TNFp55R
# T8 Protein S5 38 41 512 515 p65
# T9 Protein S5 53 56 527 530 p65
# T10 Protein S5 132 135 606 609 p65
# T11 Protein S5 146 149 620 623 p65

In contrast, p65-Thr435 phosphorylation was increased in endothelial cells (not astrocytes) within the PC of saline-infused animals 12 hr after SE (Figure 5A).
# T12 Protein S6 13 16 680 683 p65

In addition, sTNFp55R infusion effectively alleviated SE-induced p65-Thr435 phosphorylation in endothelial cells, compared to saline infusion (p < 0.05, Figure 5B).
