Deletion reporter gene analysis of LPS and PMA-responsive regions in the murine SerpinB2 promoter.
# T1 Protein S1 80 88 80 88 SerpinB2

(A) Schematic representation of the murine SerpinB2 promoter and 5' deletion luciferase reporter constructs.
# T2 Protein S2 43 96 142 195 SerpinB2 promoter and 5' deletion luciferase reporter

The murine 5' flanking region from -4480 to +92 was inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter gene and 5' deletions were generated using restriction enzyme sites or with specific oligonucleotide PCR primers.
# T3 Protein S3 77 87 285 295 luciferase

Construct names indicate the most 5' nucleotide of murine SerpinB2 5' flanking sequence.
# T4 Protein S4 58 66 477 485 SerpinB2

(B) RAW 264.7 macrophages were transiently transfected with the indicated murine SerpinB2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs and control plasmids.
# T5 Protein S5 81 118 589 626 SerpinB2 promoter-luciferase reporter

Cells were either left untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml LPS or 40 ng/ml PMA for 16 hrs.

Shown is the relative luciferase reporter gene activity following treatment.
# T6 Protein S7 22 32 773 783 luciferase

The results represent the mean and SEM of four independent experiments.

(C) DNA sequence conservation between the human and murine SerpinB2 5' flanking regions.
# T7 Protein S9 59 67 959 967 SerpinB2

Schematic representation of the human and murine SerpinB2 5' flanking regions with regions of nucleotide sequence identity indicated by the same colored boxes.
# T8 Protein S10 49 57 1038 1046 SerpinB2

Homologous regions are interrupted by repetitive sequence elements in both 5' flanking regions.

Alu = Alu repeat, ID4 =  ID4 short interspersed nuclear repeat (SINE), L1 =  L1 long interspersed nuclear element (LINE), L2 =  L2 LINE, MIR = MIR SINE, MLT1L = MLT1L long terminal repeat (LTR), (TATG)n = TATG tetranucleotide repeat, tis = transcription initiation site.
