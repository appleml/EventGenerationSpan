NF-kappaB and NFAT5 binding play independent activating roles in MTb-mediated induction of HIV-1 replication
# T1 Protein S1 14 19 14 19 NFAT5

We next examined the functional impact of specifically disrupting NF-kappaB or NFAT5 binding on regulation of HIV-1 replication by infecting bulk PBMC from four normal donors with the wild-type or mutant HIV-1Lai/Bal-env molecular clones.

After overnight infection, cells were co-infected with MTb (CDC1551) or mock-infected and free virus levels were detected by measuring p24 levels in culture supernatants at days 4, 7, and 12 post-HIV-1 infection.

Replication of each mutant virus was reduced in comparison to wild-type virus in mock- and MTb-co-infected cells at all timepoints examined (Figures 4A-4B).

As depicted in the histograms displayed in Figure 4C, at day 12 post-HIV-1 infection in MTb-co-infected cells there was a significant reduction in levels of HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB II-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I+II-Mut, and HIV-1Lai/Bal-env -N5-Mut in comparison to wild-type virus (Figure 4C).

# T8 Protein S5 271 274 989 992 env

In the absence of MTb co-infection, p24 levels were also significantly lower in the PBMC cultures infected with HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB II-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I+II-Mut and HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-N5-Mut, but not HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I-Mut, in comparison to wild-type virus (Figure 4C).

None of the mutations completely abolished viral induction by MTb co-infection.

However, the replication of each mutant virus was impaired to a more significant extent in the context of MTb co-infection, consistent with important roles for both NF-kappaB and NFAT5 in MTb-induced HIV-1 replication.

To specifically examine the functional impact of NF-kappaB and NFAT5 binding site usage in MDM, which are efficiently infected by both pathogens, we next isolated MDM from four normal donors and infected these cells with 1000 TCID50 of wild-type HIV-1Lai/Bal-env or with the mutant viral clones HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB II-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I+II-Mut, or HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-N5-Mut.

After overnight incubation, cell cultures were co-infected with MTb (CDC1551) or left infected with virus alone.

Supernatants were collected at days 4, 7, and 12 post-HIV-1 infection and virus replication was measured.

As shown in Figures 5A and 5C, in the absence of MTb co-infection, replication of mutant viral molecular clones (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I-Mut (p<0.05), HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB II-Mut (p<0.01), and HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I+II-Mut (p<0.01) as well as HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-N5-Mut (p<0.01) were significantly reduced in comparison to the wild-type virus (Figures 5A-5C).

# T23 Protein S12 264 267 2540 2543 env

When the cultures were co-infected with MTb, p24 levels increased when the cells were infected with either the wild-type or, to lower levels, with the kappaB-I mutant virus (Figure 5B).
# T24 Protein S13 45 48 2686 2689 p24

However, p24 levels were significantly inhibited in cells infected with HIV-1Lai/Bal-env -N5-Mut (p<0.01) (Figure 5D).
# T25 Protein S14 9 12 2836 2839 p24
# T26 Protein S14 85 88 2912 2915 env

Moreover, p24 levels were significantly lower at day 12 in cultures infected with HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB II-Mut and HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I+II-Mut as compared to infection of cells with wild-type virus (Figure 5D).

# T28 Protein S15 95 98 3041 3044 env
# T29 Protein S15 130 133 3076 3079 env

Notably, although replication of the mutant virus with the single, proximal NF-kappaB binding site mutation in the shared NFAT5/NF-kappaB element (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I-Mut) was diminished, this was not significant at day 12 (Figures 5B-5D).
# T30 Protein S16 160 163 3324 3327 env

We note that overall p24 levels were noticeably lower in the cultures co-infected with MTb compared with those infected with HIV-1 alone.
# T31 Protein S17 21 24 3431 3434 p24

This is consistent with previous observations showing that MTb infection of human primary macrophage cultures ex vivo suppresses HIV-1 infection due to chemokine synthesis and the enhanced expression of cellular inhibitory factors [48]-[50].

Given that NF-kappaB is efficiently activated in primary MDM in response to TLR agonists [51] and as we have shown in Figure 2, NFAT5 gene expression is also induced by TLR agonists, MDM are a suitable experimental system to analyze the effect of NF-kappaB versus NFAT5 binding site mutations on virus replication in isolated MDM in the absence or presence of MTb co-infection.
# T32 Protein S19 128 133 3918 3923 NFAT5

Taken together, the results from PBMC and MDM co-infection experiments demonstrate that the conserved NFAT5 binding site plays as important a transcriptional role in LTR regulation by MTb as do the NF-kappaB sites.
