NF-kappaB and NFAT5 binding to the HIV-1 LTR can be specifically disrupted
# T1 Protein S1 14 19 14 19 NFAT5

To demonstrate that the impact of NFAT5 silencing on MTb-induced viral replication was a direct effect due to modulation of recruitment of NFAT5 to the HIV-1 LTR and not due to secondary, NFAT5-regulated effects, we set out to disrupt NFAT5 binding to the viral LTR in the context of HIV-1/MTb co-infection.

# T3 Protein S2 139 144 214 219 NFAT5
# T4 Protein S2 188 193 263 268 NFAT5
# T5 Protein S2 235 240 310 315 NFAT5

This series of experiments also allowed us to dissect the relative importance of NFAT5 and NF-kappaB binding to the HIV-1 LTR in MTb regulation of HIV-1 replication.

To perform these experiments, we constructed a panel of infectious HIV-1Lai/Bal-env molecular clones where either the NFAT5 site was specifically disrupted or the two NF-kappaB binding sites were either individually or dually disrupted (Figure 3A).
# T7 Protein S4 80 83 629 632 env

Specifically, we constructed a clone in which the NFAT5 binding site was mutated (named HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-N5-Mut) by changing the CC dinucleotide to TT in the core NFAT5 binding site and introduced substitution mutations into the NF-kappaB/NFAT5 shared binding element that we predicted would disrupt NF-kappaB binding but preserve NFAT5 binding.
# T8 Protein S5 101 104 899 902 env
# T9 Protein S5 331 336 1129 1134 NFAT5

Specifically, we mutated two guanines (GG) in the kappaB I site and changed them to thymine and adenine (TA) (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I-mut) and also introduced the same GG to TA change in the second, more distal NF-kappaB site (kappaB II) in HIV-1Lai/Bal-env (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB II-Mut).

# T11 Protein S6 256 259 1400 1403 env
# T12 Protein S6 274 277 1418 1421 env

We also created a double NF-kappaB site mutant virus (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I+II-Mut) in order to test the impact of complete disruption of NF-kappaB binding to the HIV-1 LTR on MTb regulation.

To determine the specificity of these substitutions upon NFAT5 and NF-kappaB p50/p65 binding to the LTR, we performed a quantitative DNase I footprinting analysis using the wild-type LTR or mutant LTRs in combination with increasing concentrations of recombinant NFAT5 or NF-kappaB p50/p65 proteins.
# T14 Protein S8 57 62 1691 1696 NFAT5
# T15 Protein S8 77 80 1711 1714 p50
# T16 Protein S8 81 84 1715 1718 p65
# T17 Protein S8 133 140 1767 1774 DNase I
# T18 Protein S8 263 268 1897 1902 NFAT5
# T19 Protein S8 282 285 1916 1919 p50
# T20 Protein S8 286 289 1920 1923 p65

As shown in Figure 3B, the N5-Mut LTR could not bind NFAT5 (compare lanes 12-15 and lanes 17-20), but p50/p65 binding was not impaired (compare lanes 2-5 with lanes 7-10).
# T21 Protein S9 53 58 1987 1992 NFAT5
# T22 Protein S9 102 105 2036 2039 p50
# T23 Protein S9 106 109 2040 2043 p65

By contrast, changing the GG dinucleotide to TA in either NF-kappaB binding motif, as predicted, inhibited p50/p65 binding at each site (compare lanes 2-5 with lanes 7-10 and lanes 12-15 of Figure 3C).
# T24 Protein S10 107 110 2213 2216 p50
# T25 Protein S10 111 114 2217 2220 p65

As expected, mutation of both NF-kappaB sites (kappaB I+II-Mut) resulted in abrogation of p50/p65 binding to the LTR.
# T26 Protein S11 90 93 2398 2401 p50
# T27 Protein S11 94 97 2402 2405 p65

However, recombinant NFAT5 binding to the single and the double NF-kappaB mutant LTRs was not impaired and indeed appeared enhanced (compare lanes 2-5 to lanes 7-20 of Figure 3D).
# T28 Protein S12 21 26 2447 2452 NFAT5

Thus, binding of NFAT5 or NF-kappaB p50/p65 to their respective motifs can be specifically disrupted within an overlapping or shared binding site.
