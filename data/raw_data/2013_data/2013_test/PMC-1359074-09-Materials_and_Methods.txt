Plasmid construction.

The epsilony promoter deletion reporter plasmid (E-luc) was generated by PCR amplification of the epsilony proximal promoter.
# T1 Protein S2 4 12 26 34 epsilony
# T2 Protein S2 98 106 120 128 epsilony

A 2.2-kb fragment upstream of the epsilony globin initiation codon (ATG) was used, because it has been shown that all sequences required for epsilon gene silencing are located within a 3.7-kb EcoRI fragment containing about 2 kb of sequence upstream of the epsilon globin gene cap site [50].
# T3 Protein S3 34 49 182 197 epsilony globin
# T4 Protein S3 141 148 289 296 epsilon
# T5 Protein S3 257 271 405 419 epsilon globin

Nucleotide numbering is relative to the transcription start site.

The transcriptional start site is based on the longest cDNA in the Fantom (Functional Annotation of Mouse) database.

The PCR primers contained XhoI and HindIII sites that were used to clone the epsilony promoter fragment upstream of the firefly luciferase gene in pGL3 Basic (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States).
# T6 Protein S6 77 85 700 708 epsilony
# T7 Protein S6 128 138 751 761 luciferase

A 2.5-kb SstI/XhoI fragment of muLCRbeta 9.3 (micro LCR; [31]) was then inserted upstream of the epsilony promoter in the above pGL3 Basic plasmid, resulting in a reporter construct in which luciferase expression is driven by the epsilony promoter.
# T8 Protein S7 97 105 924 932 epsilony
# T9 Protein S7 191 201 1018 1028 luciferase
# T10 Protein S7 230 238 1057 1065 epsilony

A series of deletion constructs of the epsilony promoter were generated similarly.
# T11 Protein S8 39 47 1115 1123 epsilony

Forward primers with an XhoI site include: MHB1457, 5'CCGCTCGAGTGCTAGGCAAACACTCA3' (-2077 to -2052); MHB1503, 5'CCGCTCGAGTCTCTACACTGTCACTCCCTG3' (-634 to -605); MHB1505, 5'CCGCTCGAGGGAGCCAAAAAAAGAATGC3' (-197 to -169); MHB1506, 5'CCGCTCGAGCTGACCAATGGCTTCAAAG3' (-85 to -58); MHB1532, 5'CCGCTCGAGAATGCAGAACAAAGGGTCAGA3' (-63 to -34); and MHB1507, 5'CCGCTCGAGGTCTGCGAAGAATAAAAGGC 3' (-37 to -9).

All forward primers were used in combination with the reverse primer HindIII site: MHB1477, 5'CGGAAGCTTGGGAGGTTGCTGGTGA3' (+45 to +20).

Sox6-pcDNA3.1 [15] was used to overexpress Sox6.
# T12 Protein S11 0 4 1689 1693 Sox6
# T13 Protein S11 43 47 1732 1736 Sox6

A truncated version of the Sox6 overexpression construct (Sox6-deltaHMG-pcDNA3.1) that lacks the HMG domain was generated, as described by others [32].
# T14 Protein S12 27 31 1765 1769 Sox6
# T15 Protein S12 58 62 1796 1800 Sox6

Mutagenesis of Sox/Sox6 consensus binding sites of the epsilony promoter were done by PCR.
# T16 Protein S13 55 63 1945 1953 epsilony

Forward primers used to generate these mutagenized epsilony promoter reporter constructs include: MHB1661, 5'CCGCTCGAGAATGCAGTGCCAAGGGTCAGAACATTGTCTGCGAAG3' (-63 to -19); MHB1662, 5'CCGCTCGAGAATGCAGAACAAAGGGTCAGATGAGTGTCTGCGAAGAA3' (-63 to -16); and MHB1663, 5'CCGCTCGAGAATGCATGCCAAGGGTCAGATGAGTGTCTGCGAAGAA 3' (-63 to -18).
