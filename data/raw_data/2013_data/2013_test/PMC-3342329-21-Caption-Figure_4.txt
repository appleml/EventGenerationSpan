Upregulation of IL-1Ra in the tumor and spleen of CCR5-/- mice.
# T1 Protein S1 16 22 16 22 IL-1Ra
# T2 Protein S1 50 54 50 54 CCR5

A, Figure 4A indicates mouse cytokine array panel coordinates.

Nitrocellulose membranes contain 40 different anti-cytokine antibodies printed in duplicate.

B, Mouse cytokine array panel indicate the cytokine expression difference in tumor tissues of CCR5+/+ mice and CCR5-/- mice, especially IL-1Ra.
# T3 Protein S4 94 98 314 318 CCR5
# T4 Protein S4 111 115 331 335 CCR5
# T5 Protein S4 136 142 356 362 IL-1Ra

Representative blot from three independent experiments is shown.

Positive controls show the manufacturer's internal positive control samples on the membrane.

C, Protein immune-arrays were performed using Mouse cytokine array in spleen tissues.

There were differences in cytokines between CCR5+/+ mice and CCR5-/- mice, especially IL-1Ra.
# T6 Protein S8 44 48 652 656 CCR5
# T7 Protein S8 61 65 669 673 CCR5
# T8 Protein S8 86 92 694 700 IL-1Ra

Representative blot from three independent experiments is shown.

Positive controls show the manufacturer's internal positive control samples on the membrane.

D and E, Immunolfluorescence analysis was used to determine the expression levels of IL-1Ra in tumor and spleen tissues.
# T9 Protein S11 85 91 945 951 IL-1Ra

The reactive cell number was determined as the number of DAPI-stained, IL-1Ra antibody-positive cells that were counted.

Values are the mean +/- S.D. of four experimental animals.

* indicates statistically significant differences from CCR5+/+ mice.
# T10 Protein S14 55 59 1216 1220 CCR5

Scale bar indicates 50 microm.

F and G, Expression of IL-1Ra was analyzed by western blotting in tumor and spleen tissues.
# T11 Protein S16 23 29 1284 1290 IL-1Ra

Each band is representative of three independent experimental results.

Data are means +/- S.D. of three experimental animals.

* indicates significant difference from CCR5+/+ mice (p<0.05).
# T12 Protein S19 40 44 1519 1523 CCR5
