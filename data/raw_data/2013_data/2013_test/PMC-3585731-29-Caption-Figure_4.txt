Late Thr308 phosphorylation of Akt contributes to necroptosis.

(A) L929 cells were treated with zVAD.fmk and bFGF or PDGF, with or without Nec-1, for the indicated periods of time.
# T1 Protein S2 46 50 109 113 bFGF

(B,C) L929 cells were stimulated by zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha (B) or bFGF/zVAD.fmk under serum free conditions (C).
# T2 Protein S3 48 56 229 237 TNFalpha

Akt inh.

VIII was added 15 min before necroptotic stimulation (Pre) or at indicated times after stimulation.

Viability was measured 24 hr after activation of necroptosis.

(D) L929 cells were stimulated with bFGF/zVAD under serum free conditions.
# T4 Protein S7 36 40 499 503 bFGF

PD173074 was added 15 min before or 1 hr after FGF/zVAD.

Samples for western blot were collected at 15 min and 9 hr time points.

(E) Cells were pretreated with PD173074 or it was added 1 hr after bFGF/zVAD.fmk, followed by viability assessment at 24 hr.
# T5 Protein S10 67 71 734 738 bFGF

In all graphs, average+/-SD was plotted.
