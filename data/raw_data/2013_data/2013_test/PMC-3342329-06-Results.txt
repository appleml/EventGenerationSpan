Induction of CD8 T cells and NK Cell Infiltration into Tumor and Spleen of CCR5-/- Mice
# T1 Protein S1 75 79 75 79 CCR5

To investigate whether the inhibition of tumor growth in CCR5-/- mice is related to tumor-specific immune responses, we analyzed the distribution patterns of CD8+ cytotoxic T cell and CD57+ Natural Killer cells in tumor and spleen tissues.
# T2 Protein S2 57 61 145 149 CCR5

By staining the tumor sections from CCR5-/- mice, we found that there was a significant influx of CD8+ cells into the tumor, as well as an increase in the number of infiltrating NK cells (Figure 5A).
# T3 Protein S3 36 40 364 368 CCR5

CD8+ T cells and CD57+ NK cells were spread diffusely throughout the entire sections.

To further investigate the differences in the numbers of CD8+ T cells and CD57+ NK cells between CCR5+/+ mice and CCR5-/- mice in immunity-related organ, we also analyzed the CD8 and CD57 reactive cell number in spleen tissues.
# T4 Protein S5 97 101 711 715 CCR5
# T5 Protein S5 114 118 728 732 CCR5

The number of CD8+ T cells and CD57+ NK cells were higher in the spleen of the CCR5-/- mice than in the spleen of the CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 5B).
# T6 Protein S6 79 83 921 925 CCR5
# T7 Protein S6 118 122 960 964 CCR5

These data suggest that by promoting the infiltration of CD8 T cells and NK cells, which are potent cytotoxic effectors for tumors, could play a role in an anti-tumor effect in CCR5-/- mice.
# T8 Protein S7 177 181 1163 1167 CCR5

To analyze the cell phenotype change in CCR5-/- mice and CCR5+/+ mice by inoculation of the melanoma cell, lymphocytes were isolated from the tumor and spleen tissues.
# T9 Protein S8 40 44 1217 1221 CCR5
# T10 Protein S8 57 61 1234 1238 CCR5

The B, CD3 T, CD4 T, CD 8 T and NK cell portion of CCR5-/- mice tumor tissue were 7.2%, 48.2%, 16.9%, 32.1% and 7.8%, respectively, compared to 2.9%, 11.1%, 2.3%, 0.6% and 3.1% of CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 5C).
# T11 Protein S9 14 17 1359 1362 CD4
# T12 Protein S9 51 55 1396 1400 CCR5
# T13 Protein S9 180 184 1525 1529 CCR5

The lymphocytes that infiltrated the tumor tissue of the CCR5-/- mice also had higher levels of CD19, CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD57 when compared to the CCR5+/+ mice.
# T14 Protein S10 57 61 1608 1612 CCR5
# T15 Protein S10 96 100 1647 1651 CD19
# T16 Protein S10 107 110 1658 1661 CD4
# T17 Protein S10 146 150 1697 1701 CCR5

The B, CD3 T, CD4 T, CD 8 T and NK cell portion of the CCR5-/- mice spleen were 61.3%, 33.4%, 17.6%, 9.2% and 0.6%, respectively compared to 38.3%, 5.9%, 4.0%, 1.0% and 3.9% of the CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 5D).
# T18 Protein S11 14 17 1725 1728 CD4
# T19 Protein S11 55 59 1766 1770 CCR5
# T20 Protein S11 181 185 1892 1896 CCR5

These data suggest that by promoting the infiltration of CD8 T cells and NK cells, which are potent cytotoxic effectors for tumors, could play a role in the inhibition of tumor growth in CCR5-/- mice.
