MTb increases NFAT5 mRNA levels in human MDM
# T1 Protein S1 14 19 14 19 NFAT5

Given that macrophages, which are the primary target of MTb infection, are also a major reservoir of HIV-1 as infection progresses [40], we next investigated whether MTb is able to directly enhance NFAT5 mRNA expression in primary human MDM.
# T2 Protein S2 198 203 243 248 NFAT5

We prepared MDM from five normal donors, stimulated the cells with the MTb lysate or left them unstimulated, and measured NFAT5 gene expression levels by quantitative real-time PCR at 24 and 48 hours.
# T3 Protein S3 122 127 409 414 NFAT5

We also investigated whether HIV-1 infection is capable of inducing NFAT5 mRNA synthesis by infecting MDM with live or heat-inactivated R5-tropic representatives of subtype B (HIV-1Bal), C (HIV-198IN22), or E (HIV-192TH64).
# T4 Protein S4 68 73 556 561 NFAT5

As shown in Figure 2A, stimulation with MTb lysate significantly increased NFAT5 mRNA levels at 24 (p<0.05) and 48 (p<0.01) hours, whereas infection with viable or heat-inactivated HIV-1 isolates did not increase NFAT5 mRNA levels (Figure 2A).
# T5 Protein S5 75 80 787 792 NFAT5
# T6 Protein S5 213 218 925 930 NFAT5

Thus, MTb specifically enhances NFAT5 mRNA expression in human MDM, and this response continues to increase for at least 48 hours post-stimulation (Figure 2A).
