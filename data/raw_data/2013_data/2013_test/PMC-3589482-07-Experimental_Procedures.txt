Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays (RAW264.7 Macrophages)
# T1 Protein S1 27 37 27 37 Luciferase

RAW 264.7 cells (2x107) growing in log phase were transfected with the indicated luciferase reporter plasmid (20 microg) along with the pRL-thymidine kinase (TK) (Promega) internal control reporter plasmid (2 microg) by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser with a Capacitance Extender (0.25 kV, 960 microFd).
# T2 Protein S2 81 91 149 159 luciferase
# T3 Protein S2 140 156 208 224 thymidine kinase
# T4 Protein S2 158 160 226 228 TK

pGL3 control plasmid which encodes the SV40 promoter and enhancer was included as a positive control for transfection efficiency, and as an internal standard for promoter and enhancer activities.

Transfected cells were transferred to 10 ml of pre-warmed media in 6-well tissue culture plates, divided into two identical cell pools and incubated 16 hrs in a 5% CO2 and 95% humidified air atmosphere at 37degreesC either in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml LPS.

Luciferase activity was measured using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System kit (Promega).
# T5 Protein S5 0 10 848 858 Luciferase
# T6 Protein S5 46 56 894 904 Luciferase

Measurements represent the results of at least three independent experiments.

Promoter activity is expressed as the number of firefly luciferase light units normalized either to pRL-TK renilla luciferase light units or to cellular protein concentration (where co-transfected C/EBP-beta or LPS affected pRL-TK activity).
# T7 Protein S7 56 66 1076 1086 luciferase
# T8 Protein S7 104 106 1124 1126 TK
# T9 Protein S7 115 125 1135 1145 luciferase
# T10 Protein S7 197 207 1217 1227 C/EBP-beta
# T11 Protein S7 228 230 1248 1250 TK

Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein microassay reagent.
