Persistent Expression of the Embryonic Globin, epsilony, in Sox6-Deficient Mice
# T1 Protein S1 39 45 39 45 Globin
# T2 Protein S1 47 55 47 55 epsilony
# T3 Protein S1 60 64 60 64 Sox6

The epsilony globin gene was initially identified as an upregulated transcript in the p100H mouse using subtractive hybridization to identify Sox6 downstream targets.
# T4 Protein S2 4 19 84 99 epsilony globin
# T5 Protein S2 142 146 222 226 Sox6

This initial observation was confirmed in an independent knock-out allele of Sox6 [13] using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (unpublished data).
# T6 Protein S3 77 81 324 328 Sox6

Real-time PCR was used to quantitate the expression levels of other globin genes in p100H mutant and WT mouse livers at two developmental stages, 15.5 dpc and 18.5 dpc.

As shown in Figure 1, the epsilony gene is expressed at high levels at both time points in mutant mice, in contrast to the decline in expression observed in WT mice.
# T7 Protein S5 26 34 597 605 epsilony

No difference was seen between WT and heterozygous mice (unpublished data).

Interestingly, the expression levels of the other two embryonic globin genes (zeta and betah1) are also higher in p100H homozygous mice, compared with WT mice, but to a much lesser extent than seen for epsilony globin at 18.5 dpc (Figure 1).
# T8 Protein S7 78 82 891 895 zeta
# T9 Protein S7 87 93 900 906 betah1
# T10 Protein S7 202 217 1015 1030 epsilony globin

Moreover, the expression level of adult beta globin is also somewhat higher in p100H homozygous mice than in WT mice at 18.5 dpc (Figure 1).
# T11 Protein S8 40 51 1095 1106 beta globin

Perinatal lethality of mutant mice (presumably from the heart defect [14]) precludes us from evaluating postnatal globin expression.

The graphs in Figure 1 illustrate real time PCR results that were performed in triplicate (standard deviation of the data is shown by error bars).

Because all of the assays were performed at the same time with the same internal control, the levels shown are relative levels and are thus comparable across all samples and are in agreement with previously published results for WT fetal mice [29].

We note that the level of epsilony expression in the livers of 15.5 dpc and 18.5 dpc homozygous mutant mice is statistically equivalent to the level of betamaj/min expression in the livers of 15.5 dpc and 18.5 dpc homozygous WT mice.
# T12 Protein S12 26 34 1751 1759 epsilony
# T13 Protein S12 152 159 1877 1884 betamaj
# T14 Protein S12 160 163 1885 1888 min
