Akt and mTORC1 control autocrine TNFalpha synthesis and JNK activation during necroptosis.
# T1 Protein S1 33 41 33 41 TNFalpha

(A) Cells were treated under serum free conditions with bFGF or PDGF with or without zVAD.fmk for 9 hr, followed by qRT-PCR analysis of mTNFalpha.
# T2 Protein S2 56 60 147 151 bFGF

Data was normalized to mouse 18S RNA.
# T4 Protein S3 29 32 267 270 18S

(B) Necroptosis was induced by zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha in cells treated with Nec-1, rapamycin (rapa), or Akt inh.

followed by qRT-PCR analysis of TNFalpha mRNA levels.
# T6 Protein S6 32 40 429 437 TNFalpha

(C-F) L929 cells with siRNA knockdown of Akt isoforms (C,E) or mTOR (D,F) were stimulated with zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha for 9 hr, followed by qRT-PCR analysis of mTNFalpha (C,D) or western blot (E,F).
