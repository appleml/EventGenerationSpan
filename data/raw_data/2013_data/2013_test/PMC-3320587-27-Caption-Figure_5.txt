Disruption of NF-kappaB or NFAT5 sites in the LTR inhibits MTb-induced HIV-1 replication in MDM.

MDM from four normal donors were infected with 1000 TCID50 of HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-WT or the mutants HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB II-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I+II-Mut, or HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-N5-Mut, and were either (A) left infected with virus alone or (B) co-infected with MTb CDC1551 (1:1 MDM:bacilli).

Viral p24 levels in the culture supernatants were measured at days 4, 7 and 12 post-infection.

Presentation of viral p24 levels at day 12 in cultures infected with (C) HIV-1 alone or (D) co-infected with MTb are shown as histograms.
