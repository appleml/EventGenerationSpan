Western Blotting

Tumor tissues were homogenized with protein extraction solution (PRO-PREPTM, Intron Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea), and lysed by 60 min incubation on ice.

The tissue lysate centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4degreesC.

Equal amounts of proteins (40 microg) were separated on a SDS/12%-polyacrylamide gel, and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (GE Water and Process technologies, Trevose, PA, USA).

Blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% (w/v) non-fat dried milk in Tris-Buffered Saline Tween-20 [TBST: 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl solution containing 0.05% Tween-20].

After a short washing in TBST, the membranes were immunoblotted with the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against p65 and p50 (1:500 dilutions; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against Bax and PARP (1:500 dilutions; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and against caspase-3, caspase-9, Bcl-2 and c-IAP-1 (1:1000 dilutions; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA).
# T1 Protein S6 148 151 789 792 p65
# T2 Protein S6 156 159 797 800 p50
# T3 Protein S6 369 376 1010 1017 c-IAP-1

The blots were incubated with the respective horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:4000 dilutions; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Immunoreactive proteins were detected with the ECL detection system.
