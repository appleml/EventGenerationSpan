Macrophages are key mediators of the innate immune response, and consequently provide the first line of defense against pathogens.

Pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as the bacterial endotoxin LPS, stimulate macrophages to mount an anti-pathogenic response which involves massive induction of the pro-survival factor SerpinB2.
# T1 Protein S2 182 190 313 321 SerpinB2

SerpinB2 is transcriptionally induced by cross talk between the IKKbeta/NF-kappaB and p38MAPK signaling modules in response to LPS [16].
# T2 Protein S3 0 8 323 331 SerpinB2
# T3 Protein S3 64 71 387 394 IKKbeta

Here we report that SerpinB2 gene transcription in response to LPS is conferred by the SerpinB2 proximal promoter and is greatly dependent upon C/EBP-beta.
# T4 Protein S4 20 28 480 488 SerpinB2
# T5 Protein S4 87 95 547 555 SerpinB2
# T6 Protein S4 144 154 604 614 C/EBP-beta

LPS-induced C/EBP-beta was shown to specifically bind the C/EBP response element in the SerpinB2 proximal promoter in vitro and in vivo, and loss of C/EBP-beta abrogates constitutive SerpinB2 gene transcription and the response to LPS.
# T7 Protein S5 12 22 628 638 C/EBP-beta
# T8 Protein S5 88 96 704 712 SerpinB2
# T9 Protein S5 149 159 765 775 C/EBP-beta
# T10 Protein S5 183 191 799 807 SerpinB2

The murine SerpinB2 proximal promoter region between nucleotides -539 and +92 mediated both PMA- and LPS-inducible gene transcription, with induction by PMA being less intense and more transient than that by LPS.
# T11 Protein S6 11 19 863 871 SerpinB2

Inspection of the murine SerpinB2 proximal promoter sequence shows that a CRE and two AP-1-like elements, demonstrated to mediate PMA-stimulated transcription of the human SERPINB2 gene [37], also are present in the murine SerpinB2 proximal promoter between nucleotides -189 and -87.
# T12 Protein S7 25 33 1090 1098 SerpinB2
# T13 Protein S7 172 180 1237 1245 SERPINB2
# T14 Protein S7 223 231 1288 1296 SerpinB2

These sites may therefore also play a role in mediating PMA-inducible transcription of the murine SerpinB2 gene.
# T15 Protein S8 98 106 1447 1455 SerpinB2

In contrast to the pattern of incremental increases in PMA-induced transcriptional activity conferred by regions of the murine SerpinB2 promoter containing these sites, most of the LPS-inducible response is dependent upon cis-acting regulatory sequences in the region between nucleotides -189 and -539.
# T16 Protein S9 127 135 1589 1597 SerpinB2

LPS responsiveness absolutely required the C/EBP binding site located in the region between nucleotides -189 and -539, with the downstream CRE and AP-1-like elements also being critical.

Of note, there are previous reports of combinatorial interactions between C/EBP-beta and CRE binding proteins (CREB) and AP-1 [63], and C/EBP-beta has been reported to physically interact with AP-1, and NF-kappaB to promote gene expression of inflammatory mediators [63]; [66].
# T17 Protein S11 74 84 2026 2036 C/EBP-beta
# T18 Protein S11 136 146 2088 2098 C/EBP-beta

Additionally, CREB has been shown to control transcription of the C/EBP-beta gene [67].
# T19 Protein S12 66 76 2296 2306 C/EBP-beta

In this study, C/EBP-beta was found to be a major requirement for both constitutive and LPS-induced SerpinB2 gene transcription.
# T20 Protein S13 15 25 2333 2343 C/EBP-beta
# T21 Protein S13 100 108 2418 2426 SerpinB2

In a previous microarray expression profiling study, SerpinB2 was identified as gene whose induction in C/EBP-beta-deficient peritoneal macrophages by LPS and IFNgamma was severely impaired compared to wild-type macrophages [68].
# T22 Protein S14 53 61 2500 2508 SerpinB2
# T23 Protein S14 80 84 2527 2531 gene
# T24 Protein S14 104 114 2551 2561 C/EBP-beta
# T25 Protein S14 159 167 2606 2614 IFNgamma

Our qPCR results validate this finding, as we found that both constitutive and LPS-inducible SerpinB2 mRNA expression is significantly abrogated in C/EBP-beta-shRNA transduced peritoneal macrophages, emphasizing the link between C/EBP-beta and SerpinB2 gene transcription.
# T26 Protein S15 93 101 2770 2778 SerpinB2
# T27 Protein S15 229 239 2906 2916 C/EBP-beta
# T28 Protein S15 244 252 2921 2929 SerpinB2

While C/EBP proteins can act as either homodimers or heterodimers [63], we identified C/EBP-beta as the only LPS-inducible C/EBP isoform to bind the SerpinB2 C/EBP response element, suggesting a predominant role for C/EBP-beta in LPS-induced SerpinB2 gene expression.
# T29 Protein S16 86 96 3036 3046 C/EBP-beta
# T30 Protein S16 149 157 3099 3107 SerpinB2
# T31 Protein S16 216 226 3166 3176 C/EBP-beta
# T32 Protein S16 242 250 3192 3200 SerpinB2

C/EBP-beta, like SerpinB2, plays an important role in inflammation, as it is upregulated by LPS and a host of other inflammatory cytokines [59]; [62].
# T33 Protein S17 0 10 3218 3228 C/EBP-beta
# T34 Protein S17 17 25 3235 3243 SerpinB2

Furthermore, C/EBP-beta-null mice are susceptible to bacterial infection [69]; [70] and SerpinB2 has been demonstrated to protect from bacterial and viral-induced cell death [14]-[16]; [25].
# T35 Protein S18 13 23 3382 3392 C/EBP-beta
# T36 Protein S18 88 96 3457 3465 SerpinB2

Thus the regulation of SerpinB2 gene expression by C/EBP-beta is consistent with its functional role in inflammation.
# T37 Protein S19 23 31 3583 3591 SerpinB2
# T38 Protein S19 51 61 3611 3621 C/EBP-beta

Phosphorylation of C/EBP-beta at several different amino acid residues has been shown to modulate transactivation of its target genes [63]; .
# T100 Protein S20 19 29 3697 3707 C/EBP-beta

C/EBP-beta phosphorylated on T217 has been reported to rescue macrophages from apoptosis induced by Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin (LT) [65], an activity that has also been attributed to SerpinB2 [16].
# T101 Protein S21 0 10 3820 3830 C/EBP-beta
# T102 Protein S21 188 196 4008 4016 SerpinB2

However, expression of a C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor site mutant, C/EBPbetaT217A, in Cebpb-/- MEFs did not increase SerpinB2 proximal promoter activity over that of wild-type C/EBP-beta, even though recruitment of C/EBP-betaT217 to the SerpinB2 promoter was observed to decrease following LPS stimulation of RAW264.7 cells.
# T103 Protein S22 25 64 4048 4087 C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor site mutant
# T104 Protein S22 66 80 4089 4103 C/EBPbetaT217A
# T105 Protein S22 85 90 4108 4113 Cebpb
# T106 Protein S22 116 124 4139 4147 SerpinB2
# T107 Protein S22 175 185 4198 4208 C/EBP-beta
# T108 Protein S22 236 244 4259 4267 SerpinB2

These data indicate that the T217 phospho-acceptor site is not important for the regulation of SerpinB2 gene expression.
# T109 Protein S23 95 103 4442 4450 SerpinB2

Similarly, expression of the C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor site mutant, C/EBP-betaT188A, did not affect SerpinB2 promoter activity differently from that of wild-type.
# T110 Protein S24 29 68 4497 4536 C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor site mutant
# T111 Protein S24 70 85 4538 4553 C/EBP-betaT188A
# T112 Protein S24 102 110 4570 4578 SerpinB2

In contrast, expression of C/EBP-betaS64A significantly enhanced LPS-induced SerpinB2 promoter activity, indicating that phosphorylation of C/EBP-beta at S64 negatively regulates LPS-induced SerpinB2 promoter activity.
# T113 Protein S25 27 41 4660 4674 C/EBP-betaS64A
# T114 Protein S25 77 85 4710 4718 SerpinB2
# T115 Protein S25 140 150 4773 4783 C/EBP-beta
# T116 Protein S25 191 199 4824 4832 SerpinB2

Since C/EBP-beta S64 is constitutively phosphorylated in both RAW264.7 cells and MEFs [73], it is likely that dephosphorylation at this site may be a critical event during LPS-induced transcription of SerpinB2 to increase its promoter activity.
# T117 Protein S26 6 16 4858 4868 C/EBP-beta
# T118 Protein S26 201 209 5053 5061 SerpinB2

Roy and colleagues demonstrated that Mixed lineage kinase-3 (MLK3)-driven dephosphorylation of C/EBP-beta S64 was important for IFNgamma-regulated signaling pathways [73].
# T119 Protein S27 37 59 5134 5156 Mixed lineage kinase-3
# T120 Protein S27 61 65 5158 5162 MLK3
# T121 Protein S27 95 105 5192 5202 C/EBP-beta
# T122 Protein S27 128 136 5225 5233 IFNgamma

Our data suggest that MLK3-driven dephosphorylation of S64 may also be involved in LPS-signaling pathways.
# T123 Protein S28 22 26 5291 5295 MLK3

In recent years it has become apparent that persistent infection is integrally linked to chronic inflammation and cancer, and immune cells such as macrophages can either promote or attenuate cancer progression [2]; [74]-[76].

SerpinB2 expression has been associated with both inflammation and cancer, and is a favorable or unfavorable prognostic indicator depending on cancer type [77].
# T124 Protein S30 0 8 5602 5610 SerpinB2

The presence of SerpinB2 has been shown to modulate cytokine profiles which can affect immune cell polarization [27]; [28]; [77]; [78].
# T125 Protein S31 16 24 5779 5787 SerpinB2

Interestingly C/EBP-beta has also been shown to modulate cytokine secretion from immune cells, thereby modifying their phenotype [27]; [79]-[81].
# T126 Protein S32 14 24 5913 5923 C/EBP-beta

Our study has demonstrated that C/EBP-beta plays an important role in mediating both constitutive and LPS-induced transcription of the SerpinB2 gene, which may have implications for the inflammatory phenotype of infiltrating immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.
# T127 Protein S33 32 42 6077 6087 C/EBP-beta
# T128 Protein S33 135 143 6180 6188 SerpinB2

In summary, our studies show that the C/EBP site (-203/-195) in the murine SerpinB2 proximal promoter is necessary to support both constitutive and LPS-induced SerpinB2 gene expression.
# T129 Protein S34 75 83 6389 6397 SerpinB2
# T130 Protein S34 160 168 6474 6482 SerpinB2

Importantly, we were able to uncover a previously unknown role for C/EBP-betaS64 in negatively regulating SerpinB2 promoter activity.
# T131 Protein S35 106 114 6606 6614 SerpinB2

Taken together these data provide new insight into the regulation of inflammation-associated SerpinB2 gene expression.
# T132 Protein S36 93 101 6727 6735 SerpinB2
