Activation of TLR4-Mediated NF-Kappa-B Signaling
# T1 Protein S2 14 18 19 23 TLR4

Activation of TLR4 induces the phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa-B (IkappaB), which dissociates IkappaB with NF-kappa-B (NFkappaB).
# T2 Protein S3 14 18 68 72 TLR4

Then, NFkappaB translocates into the nucleus and activates and regulates the transcription of genes related to inflammatory responses.

To detectd the activation of TLR4-mediated NFkappaB signaling, the phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa-B (p-IkappaB) and activity of NFkappaB were measured by methods of Western Blots and EMSA.
# T3 Protein S5 29 33 354 358 TLR4

Results showed that the p-IkappaB increased at 6 hours after ICH (P < .05), peaked on 3 days after ICH, and maintained a high level on 7 days after ICH (P < .05, Figure 5).

As expected, the activity of NFkappaB was also increased in the same manner as that of the p-IkappaB (Figure 4).
