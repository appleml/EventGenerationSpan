Real-time Quantitative PCR (qPCR)

The RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) was used to isolate total RNA from cells.

For cDNA synthesis, 1 microg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using TaqMan(R) Reverse Transcription Reagents (Applied Biosystems).

qPCR was performed using TaqMan(R) Gene Expression 20X primers for Serpinb2/SerpinB2 (Mm00440905_m1), Cebpb (Mm00843434_s1) and beta-actin (Mm00607939_s1) (Applied Biosystems).
# T1 Protein S4 67 75 307 315 Serpinb2
# T2 Protein S4 76 84 316 324 SerpinB2
# T3 Protein S4 102 107 342 347 Cebpb
# T4 Protein S4 128 138 368 378 beta-actin
