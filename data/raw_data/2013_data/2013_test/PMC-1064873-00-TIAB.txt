Resistance to IL-10 inhibition of interferon gamma production and expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 in CD4+T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis
# T1 Protein S1 14 19 14 19 IL-10
# T2 Protein S1 34 50 34 50 interferon gamma
# T3 Protein S1 80 114 80 114 suppressor of cytokine signaling 1
# T4 Protein S1 118 121 118 121 CD4

IL-10 has been shown to block the antigen-specific T-cell cytokine response by inhibiting the CD28 signaling pathway.

# T6 Protein S2 94 98 264 268 CD28

We found that peripheral blood CD4+ T cells from patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were able to produce greater amounts of interferon gamma after CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10 than were normal control CD4+ T cells, although their surface expression of the type 1 IL-10 receptor was increased.
# T7 Protein S3 31 34 319 322 CD4
# T8 Protein S3 136 152 424 440 interferon gamma
# T9 Protein S3 167 171 455 459 CD28
# T10 Protein S3 213 218 501 506 IL-10
# T11 Protein S3 244 247 532 535 CD4
# T12 Protein S3 299 320 587 608 type 1 IL-10 receptor

The phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 was sustained in both blood and synovial tissue CD4+ T cells of RA, but it was not augmented by the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10.
# T13 Protein S4 23 73 647 697 signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
# T14 Protein S4 122 125 746 749 CD4
# T15 Protein S4 194 199 818 823 IL-10

Sera from RA patients induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation in normal CD4+ T cells, which was mostly abolished by neutralizing anti-IL-6 antibody.
# T16 Protein S5 30 80 855 905 signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
# T17 Protein S5 107 110 932 935 CD4
# T18 Protein S5 169 173 994 998 IL-6

Preincubation of normal CD4+ T cells with IL-6 reduced IL-10-mediated inhibition of interferon gamma production.
# T19 Protein S6 24 27 1033 1036 CD4
# T20 Protein S6 42 46 1051 1055 IL-6
# T21 Protein S6 55 60 1064 1069 IL-10
# T22 Protein S6 84 100 1093 1109 interferon gamma

Blood CD4+ T cells from RA patients contained higher levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 but lower levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 mRNA compared with control CD4+ T cells, as determined by real-time PCR.
# T23 Protein S7 6 9 1128 1131 CD4
# T24 Protein S7 63 97 1185 1219 suppressor of cytokine signaling 1
# T25 Protein S7 118 152 1240 1274 suppressor of cytokine signaling 3
# T26 Protein S7 180 183 1302 1305 CD4

These results indicate that RA CD4+ T cells become resistant to the immunosuppressive effect of IL-10 before migration into synovial tissue, and this impaired IL-10 signaling may be associated with sustained signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 induction.
