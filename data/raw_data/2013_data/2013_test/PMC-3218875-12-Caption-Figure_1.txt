Canonical NF-kappaB signalling and negative regulators.

Ligand engagement of specific membrane receptors such as TNFR1, CD40, RANK, and TLR4 trigger the recruitment of specific adaptor proteins (TNF receptor 1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), MyD88, MAL, TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFNbeta (TRIF)), kinases (RIP1, IRAK1, IRAK4), and ubiquitin ligases (TRAF2, TRAF6, cIAP1, cIAP2) to the receptor.

K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAFs, RIP1 and IRAK1, is recognised by NEMO and TAB proteins, resulting in the recruitment and activation of respectively IKK2 and TAK1.
# T18 Protein S3 40 44 457 461 RIP1
# T19 Protein S3 49 54 466 471 IRAK1
# T20 Protein S3 73 77 490 494 NEMO
# T21 Protein S3 156 160 573 577 IKK2
# T22 Protein S3 165 169 582 586 TAK1

TAK1 then phosphorylates and activates IKK2, which in turn phosphorylates IkappaBalpha, triggering its K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.
# T23 Protein S4 0 4 588 592 TAK1
# T24 Protein S4 39 43 627 631 IKK2
# T25 Protein S4 74 86 662 674 IkappaBalpha

This allows NF-kappaB (here shown as a heterodimer of p65 and p50) to translocate to the nucleus and promote target gene expression.
# T26 Protein S5 54 57 800 803 p65
# T27 Protein S5 62 65 808 811 p50

TRAF1, which has no ubiquitin ligase activity, can negatively regulate NF-kappaB activation, most probably by competing with other TRAFs.
# T28 Protein S6 0 5 879 884 TRAF1

A20 and CYLD are deubiquitinating enzymes that control NF-kappaB activation by targeting specific signalling proteins including RIP1 and TRAF6, to which they are recruited using specific ubiquitin-binding adaptor proteins such as ABIN-1 and p62.
# T29 Protein S7 0 3 1017 1020 A20
# T30 Protein S7 8 12 1025 1029 CYLD
# T31 Protein S7 128 132 1145 1149 RIP1
# T32 Protein S7 137 142 1154 1159 TRAF6
# T33 Protein S7 230 236 1247 1253 ABIN-1
# T34 Protein S7 241 244 1258 1261 p62

miR-146 is thought to negatively regulate TLR signalling by inhibiting expression of IRAK1 and TRAF6.
# T35 Protein S8 85 90 1348 1353 IRAK1
# T36 Protein S8 95 100 1358 1363 TRAF6

Finally, TLR signalling can also be inhibited by the transmembrane protein SIGIRR, which has been proposed to compete with TLR4 for binding to IRAK1 and TRAF6.
# T37 Protein S9 75 81 1440 1446 SIGIRR
# T38 Protein S9 123 127 1488 1492 TLR4
# T39 Protein S9 143 148 1508 1513 IRAK1
# T40 Protein S9 153 158 1518 1523 TRAF6

The expression of many of these negative regulatory molecules is NF-kappaB dependent, implicating them in the negative feedback regulation of NF-kappaB activation.
