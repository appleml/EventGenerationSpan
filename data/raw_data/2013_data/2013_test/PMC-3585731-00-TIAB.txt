Akt Regulates TNFalpha Synthesis Downstream of RIP1 Kinase Activation during Necroptosis
# T1 Protein S1 14 22 14 22 TNFalpha

Necroptosis is a regulated form of necrotic cell death that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases including intestinal inflammation and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

In this work, we investigated the signaling mechanisms controlled by the necroptosis mediator receptor interacting protein-1 (RIP1) kinase.
# T3 Protein S3 94 124 389 419 receptor interacting protein-1
# T4 Protein S3 126 130 421 425 RIP1

We show that Akt kinase activity is critical for necroptosis in L929 cells and plays a key role in TNFalpha production.
# T5 Protein S4 99 107 534 542 TNFalpha

During necroptosis, Akt is activated in a RIP1 dependent fashion through its phosphorylation on Thr308.
# T6 Protein S5 42 46 597 601 RIP1

In L929 cells, this activation requires independent signaling inputs from both growth factors and RIP1.
# T7 Protein S6 98 102 757 761 RIP1

Akt controls necroptosis through downstream targeting of mammalian Target of Rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1).

Akt activity, mediated in part through mTORC1, links RIP1 to JNK activation and autocrine production of TNFalpha.
# T8 Protein S8 53 57 923 927 RIP1
# T9 Protein S8 104 112 974 982 TNFalpha

In other cell types, such as mouse lung fibroblasts and macrophages, Akt exhibited control over necroptosis-associated TNFalpha production without contributing to cell death.
# T10 Protein S9 119 127 1103 1111 TNFalpha

Overall, our results provide new insights into the mechanism of necroptosis and the role of Akt kinase in both cell death and inflammatory regulation.
