# T3 Protein S1 61 64 61 64 CD4

The CD28 costimulatory pathway is crucial for effective antigen-specific T-cell cytokine production, and IL-10 can directly suppress this response by inhibiting CD28 tyrosine phosphorylation and binding of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [24].

# T5 Protein S2 105 110 179 184 IL-10
# T6 Protein S2 161 165 235 239 CD28

To evaluate the responsiveness of RA CD4+ T cells to IL-10, purified PB CD4+ T cells from three patients with active RA and from three healthy controls were stimulated by immobilized anti-CD3 antibody and anti-CD28 antibody with or without diluted concentrations of IL-10 for 36 hours, and IFN-gamma production was measured by ELISA.

# T8 Protein S3 53 58 369 374 IL-10
# T9 Protein S3 72 75 388 391 CD4
# T10 Protein S3 188 191 504 507 CD3
# T11 Protein S3 210 214 526 530 CD28
# T12 Protein S3 266 271 582 587 IL-10
# T13 Protein S3 290 299 606 615 IFN-gamma

As shown in Fig. 1, IFN-gamma production by activated normal CD4+ T cells was mostly inhibited at concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml IL-10.
# T14 Protein S4 20 29 670 679 IFN-gamma
# T15 Protein S4 61 64 711 714 CD4
# T16 Protein S4 131 136 781 786 IL-10

However, RA CD4+ T cells were able to produce significant amounts of IFN-gamma in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10, and the maximal but not complete inhibition by IL-10 was obtained at 10-100 ng/ml.
# T17 Protein S5 12 15 800 803 CD4
# T18 Protein S5 69 78 857 866 IFN-gamma
# T19 Protein S5 106 111 894 899 IL-10
# T20 Protein S5 160 165 948 953 IL-10

We thus compared the levels of IFN-gamma production by CD4+ T cells after CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10 in RA patients with active disease (multiple inflammatory joints, CRP level >= 10 mg/l) and inactive disease (in remission, CRP level < 10 mg/l) [26] and in healthy controls.

# T22 Protein S6 55 58 1039 1042 CD4
# T23 Protein S6 74 77 1058 1061 CD3
# T24 Protein S6 82 86 1066 1070 CD28
# T25 Protein S6 128 133 1112 1117 IL-10

There were no statistically significant differences in IFN-gamma production without IL-10 among these three groups (Fig. 2a), but the inhibitory effect of IL-10 on IFN-gamma production was significantly limited in the active RA group as compared with the inactive RA group and healthy controls (percentage decrease: active RA, 2.9 +/- 14.4%; inactive RA, 45.6 +/- 14.4%; controls, 65.8 +/- 7.9%) (Fig. 2b).
# T26 Protein S7 55 64 1348 1357 IFN-gamma
# T27 Protein S7 84 89 1377 1382 IL-10
# T28 Protein S7 155 160 1448 1453 IL-10
# T29 Protein S7 164 173 1457 1466 IFN-gamma

As a consequence, CD4+ T cells from active RA patients produced higher levels of IFN-gamma in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10 than did normal CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2a).
# T30 Protein S8 18 21 1718 1721 CD4
# T31 Protein S8 81 90 1781 1790 IFN-gamma
# T32 Protein S8 118 123 1818 1823 IL-10
# T33 Protein S8 140 143 1840 1843 CD4

In addition, we compared IL-2 production by CD4+ T cells after CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence of IL-10 in active RA patients and in healthy controls.
# T34 Protein S9 25 29 1889 1893 IL-2
# T35 Protein S9 44 47 1908 1911 CD4
# T36 Protein S9 71 75 1935 1939 CD28
# T37 Protein S9 109 114 1973 1978 IL-10

Similarly, IL-2 production was not affected by 1 ng/ml IL-10 in RA patients (percentage decrease, -2.1 +/- 13.8%), while it was significantly reduced in healthy controls (61.1 +/- 13.7%; P < 0.05).
# T38 Protein S10 11 15 2037 2041 IL-2
# T39 Protein S10 55 60 2081 2086 IL-10

Taken together, these results indicate that RA CD4+ T cells become less susceptible to the immunoregulatory effect of IL-10 during the active phase.
