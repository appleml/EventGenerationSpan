The inflammatory response is a double-edged sword.

Properly orchestrated, it results in the clearing of foreign molecules and invading pathogens from the body.

Uncontrolled, it may lead to organ damage, sepsis, and even cancer [1]-[3].

Many of the pathological manifestations of the inflammatory response are mediated by cytokines and other inducible gene products expressed by macrophages upon exposure to the gram-negative bacterial cell wall component LPS.

As macrophages are key effectors of pathogen-induced innate immune responses, their survival is critical for initial pathogen neutralization and subsequent development of adaptive immune responses.

One of the most LPS-inducible macrophage gene products known is the ovalbumin-like serine protease inhibitor (ov-serpin) SerpinB2, a widely recognized macrophage survival factor [4]; [5].
# T1 Protein S6 121 129 779 787 SerpinB2

SerpinB2 was first identified as an inhibitor of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)[6]-[8], a serine protease involved in the degradation and turnover of the extracellular matrix through the activation of plasminogen [7]; [9].
# T2 Protein S7 0 8 846 854 SerpinB2
# T3 Protein S7 49 85 895 931 urokinase-type plasminogen activator
# T4 Protein S7 87 90 933 936 uPA
# T5 Protein S7 213 224 1059 1070 plasminogen

Such function requires SerpinB2 to be secreted from the cell yet SerpinB2 exists primarily as a nonglycosylated intracellular protein [10].
# T6 Protein S8 23 31 1104 1112 SerpinB2
# T7 Protein S8 65 73 1146 1154 SerpinB2

Over the past decade, intracellular roles for SerpinB2 in cell survival [11]-[17], proliferation and differentiation [18]-[21], signal transduction [15]; [22]; [23] and innate immunity [24]-[28], have been described.
# T8 Protein S9 46 54 1267 1275 SerpinB2

The SerpinB2 gene is highly regulated in a cell type specific manner analogous to that of cytokines and oncogenes [29]; [30].
# T9 Protein S10 4 12 1442 1450 SerpinB2

It is one of the most responsive genes known [31], and can be induced over 1000-fold by LPS [31]-[32], and is up-regulated by a range of inflammatory mediators [9].

LPS activates immune responses through multiple signalling pathways.

The toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is responsible for the recognition of LPS and other microbial products and plays a central role in the initiation of innate immune responses, including cytokine release.
# T10 Protein S13 4 24 1802 1822 toll-like receptor 4
# T11 Protein S13 26 30 1824 1828 TLR4

The binding of LPS to TLR4 on the surface of macrophages leads to the recruitment of adaptor molecules and the activation of protein kinases, generating signals to the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and/or phosphoinositide 3(PI3)-kinase pathways [33].
# T12 Protein S14 22 26 2022 2026 TLR4

In studies aimed at identifying LPS-inducible pro-survival factors downstream of p38 MAPK, SerpinB2 was identified as a factor whose expression was upregulated by cooperation of the IKKbeta/NF-kappaB and p38 MAPK/CREB pathways [16].
# T13 Protein S15 91 99 2387 2395 SerpinB2
# T14 Protein S15 182 189 2478 2485 IKKbeta

Our previously published data indicated that SerpinB2 is distinctly regulated from other LPS-inducible genes in terms of kinetics, LPS dose response and sensitivity to IFN-gamma co-stimulation [4]; however, the cis-acting elements in the SerpinB2 promoter responsible for LPS-dependent transcription in macrophages and the specific LPS-responsive transcription factors that bind the SerpinB2 promoter were not defined.
# T15 Protein S16 45 53 2574 2582 SerpinB2
# T16 Protein S16 168 177 2697 2706 IFN-gamma
# T17 Protein S16 238 246 2767 2775 SerpinB2
# T18 Protein S16 383 391 2912 2920 SerpinB2

Here we show that LPS induction of SerpinB2 is dependent upon cis-acting regulatory sequences in the region between nucleotides -189 and -539 of the murine SerpinB2 promoter, and is critically dependent upon a C/EBP binding site at -203/-195.
# T19 Protein S17 35 43 2983 2991 SerpinB2
# T20 Protein S17 156 164 3104 3112 SerpinB2

C/EBP-beta directly bound to this site in vivo and its deficiency abrogated constitutive SerpinB2 expression and SerpinB2 induction by LPS.
# T21 Protein S18 0 10 3191 3201 C/EBP-beta
# T22 Protein S18 89 97 3280 3288 SerpinB2
# T23 Protein S18 113 121 3304 3312 SerpinB2

Importantly, a C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor site was found to negatively regulate LPS-induced SerpinB2 promoter activity.
# T24 Protein S19 15 25 3346 3356 C/EBP-beta
# T25 Protein S19 93 101 3424 3432 SerpinB2

Together, these findings provide new insight into the transcriptional regulation of the SerpinB2 gene.
