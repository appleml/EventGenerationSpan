p53 and WWOX in GBM cell apoptosis.
# T1 Protein S1 0 3 0 3 p53
# T2 Protein S1 8 12 8 12 WWOX

(A) Full-length p53 possesses two N-terminal transactivation acidic domains, a proline-rich domain, a central DNA-binding region, and a C-terminal domain, containing a nuclear localization signal, an oligomerization domain, and a basic region.
# T3 Protein S2 16 19 52 55 p53

N-terminal deletion mutants of p53 are also shown.
# T4 Protein S3 31 34 311 314 p53

(B) Three likely scenarios are proposed for WWOX and p53 to regulate GBM cell death.
# T5 Protein S4 44 48 375 379 WWOX
# T6 Protein S4 53 56 384 387 p53

First, ectopic WWOX fails to induce apoptosis of GBM cells expressing endogenous wild type p53.
# T7 Protein S5 15 19 431 435 WWOX
# T8 Protein S5 91 94 507 510 p53

It appears that ectopic WWOX binds and functionally antagonizes p53, and both proteins nullify each other's function in inducing apoptosis.
# T9 Protein S6 24 28 536 540 WWOX
# T10 Protein S6 64 67 576 579 p53

Second, no physical interactions between mutant p53 proteins and WWOX are expected in GBM cells.
# T11 Protein S7 48 51 700 703 p53
# T12 Protein S7 65 69 717 721 WWOX

Thus, ectopic WWOX induce apoptosis in mutant p53-expressing cells.
# T13 Protein S8 14 18 763 767 WWOX
# T14 Protein S8 46 49 795 798 p53

Finally, whether WWOX binds p53 isoforms is unknown.
# T15 Protein S9 17 21 834 838 WWOX
# T16 Protein S9 28 31 845 848 p53

Also, whether ectopic WWOX induction of apoptosis in GBM cells expressing p53 isoforms remains to be established.
# T17 Protein S10 22 26 892 896 WWOX
# T18 Protein S10 74 77 944 947 p53

TAD, transactivation domain; PrD, proline domain; NLS, nuclear localization signal; OD, oligomerization domain; BR, basic region.
