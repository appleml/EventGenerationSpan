Identification of cis-acting elements required for the LPS-responsiveness of the murine SerpinB2 promoter.
# T1 Protein S1 88 96 88 96 SerpinB2

(A) Schematic representation of the -539/+92 region of the murine SerpinB2 promoter with the location of candidate cis-acting regulatory elements indicated with boxes.
# T2 Protein S2 66 74 173 181 SerpinB2

The location of the 5' ends of the -539, -189 and -87 reporter constructs is also shown.

Positions of murine SerpinB2 proximal promoter-specific primers, 338/-315 and -5/+19 used in ChIP assays are indicated.
# T3 Protein S4 20 28 384 392 SerpinB2

(B) RAW 264.7 macrophages were transiently transfected with the indicated murine SerpinB2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs and either left untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 16 hrs.
# T4 Protein S5 81 118 565 602 SerpinB2 promoter-luciferase reporter

The results show relative luciferase activity following LPS treatment and represent the mean and SEM of 4-7 independent experiments.
# T5 Protein S6 26 36 708 718 luciferase
