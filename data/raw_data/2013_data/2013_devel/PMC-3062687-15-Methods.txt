In Vitro Kinase Assay

Kinase-active recombinant IKKbeta and IKKalpha proteins were purchased from Active Motif and Millipore, respectively.
# T1 Protein S2 26 33 48 55 IKKbeta
# T2 Protein S2 38 46 60 68 IKKalpha

Bacterially purified glutathione S-transferase (GST), GST-IkappaBalpha (1-54), wild type, mutant GST-RPS3, or RPS3 proteins were used as substrates.
# T3 Protein S3 97 105 237 245 GST-RPS3
# T4 Protein S3 110 114 250 254 RPS3

The in vitro kinase assay was performed as previously described29.

Briefly, enzyme (100 ng) and substrate (2 mug) were co-incubated in IKK reaction buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM ATP) or NleH1 reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP) with 0.5 muCi 32P-gamma-ATP (GE Healthcare) added at 37 degreesC for 30 min.

The reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.
