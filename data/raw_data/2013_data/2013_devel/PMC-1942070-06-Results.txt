3.3Antigen receptor regulated signalling pathways in PKD-null DT40 B cells

To further explore the contribution of PKD kinases to DT40 B cell biology we investigated whether specific BCR-regulated signalling events were defective in the PKD-null B cells.

Initial experiments revealed that surface expression of the BCR was reduced in PKD1/3-/- (and in PKD1/3-/-:Flag-PKD3+ve) cells compared to wild-type DT40 B cells (Fig. 3A and data not shown).

# T5 Protein S3 112 116 366 370 PKD3

Nevertheless, BCR-crosslinking of PKD1/3-/- cells was sufficient to induce the activation of a number of signalling cascades, similar to that observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 3B).

# T7 Protein S4 39 40 485 486 3

Hence, BCR-induced activation of the Akt, mTOR/p70 S6 kinase (as shown by S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation) and MAPK signalling pathways was clearly detectable in PKD1/3-null B cells (Fig. 3B).

Furthermore, enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins as well as an increase in intracellular calcium levels was also observed following BCR stimulation of PKD1/3-null B cells (data not shown).

We did observe that the strength of BCR (but not phorbol ester)-induced regulation of the Erk1-RSK1 signalling pathway was reduced in PKD1/3-/- B cells compared to wild-type B cells (Fig. 3B).

# T18 Protein S7 139 140 1181 1182 3

One interpretation of this data is that PKD enzymes may modulate Erk activation.

Indeed, PKD enzymes have previously been linked to the growth factor-regulated Erk signalling in fibroblast and endothelial cell lines [33-35].

However, BCR-induced Erk phosphorylation was also reduced in PKD1/3-/--Flag-PKD3+ B cells (data not shown) suggesting that reduced BCR levels on the surface of PKD1/3-/- (and PKD1/3-/--Flag-PKD3+) B cells may itself impact on the strength of activation of this specific intracellular signalling pathway.

To search for other potential PKD targets that may show defective regulation in PKD1/3-/- DT40 B cells, we used a PKD substrate phospho-antibody that recognises consensus phosphorylation sequences targeted by PKD enzymes (LxRxxpS/T) [36].
# T27 Protein S11 80 84 1844 1848 PKD1
# T28 Protein S11 85 86 1849 1850 3

As shown in Fig. 3C, phorbol ester- and BCR-induced phosphorylation of cellular substrates detected by this phospho-antibody was similar in wild-type and PKD1/3-/- cells and is therefore independent of PKD enzymes.
# T29 Protein S12 154 158 2157 2161 PKD1
# T30 Protein S12 159 160 2162 2163 3

However, pretreatment of both wild-type and PKD1/3-/- DT40 B cells with GF109203X, a bisindoylmaleimide derivative that inhibits PKCs prevented the induction of proteins that contain phosphorylated LxRxxS/T motifs.
# T31 Protein S13 44 48 2262 2266 PKD1
# T32 Protein S13 49 50 2267 2268 3

Thus loss of PKD1/3 enzymes does not globally disrupt the phosphorylation of cellular proteins that contain LxRxxpS/T motifs.

# T34 Protein S14 18 19 2451 2452 3

This result is perhaps not surprising as LxRxxS/T motifs also act as good substrates for other serine/threonine kinases such as MAPKAPK2.
# T35 Protein S15 128 136 2687 2695 MAPKAPK2

However these experiments do provide further evidence that phosphospecific antisera are not sufficiently selective to be designated kinase specific substrate antisera.

BCR-induced signalling pathways culminate in the activation of gene transcription events that control B cell survival, proliferation and function.

In this context, it has been proposed that PKD family members control of gene transcription through activation of the NFkappaB transcription factor.

Thus, PKD-mediated activation of NFkappaB occurs downstream of a variety of different signals, including mROS/oxidative stress, lysophosphatidic acid and the Bcr-Abl oncogene [17,21,23,30,37].
# T36 Protein S19 158 174 3319 3335 Bcr-Abl oncogene

Furthermore, expression of an activated PKD1 mutant enhances HPK1-mediated NFkappaB activation [38].

In B cells, NFkappaB is known to be regulated via DAG and PKCbeta [39,40] but whether PKDs are key intermediaries for NFkappaB regulation has not been explored.
# T39 Protein S21 58 65 3513 3520 PKCbeta

The data (Fig. 4A) show that NFkappaB transcriptional activity was strongly induced in both wild-type and PKD1/3-/- DT40 B cells in response to either phorbol ester or BCR stimulation.
# T40 Protein S22 106 110 3722 3726 PKD1
# T41 Protein S22 111 112 3727 3728 3

In contrast, BCR and phorbol ester-induced NFkappaB transcriptional activity was abolished in PKCbeta-/- DT40 B cells (Fig. 4A), although strong activation of PKD kinases (as assessed by autophosphorylation of PKD1 at S916) was observed in the PKCbeta-/- cells (Fig. 4B).

Thus, PKD kinases are neither essential nor sufficient to mediate BCR-induced NFkappaB activation in DT40 B cells and hence do not participate in DAG/PKC mediated control of NFkappaB.
