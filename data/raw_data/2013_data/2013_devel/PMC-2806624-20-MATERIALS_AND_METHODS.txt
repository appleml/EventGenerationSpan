Pull-down assay.

HEK293T cells were transfected with RUNX1 or RUNX3 using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction.

Cells were lysed by sonication in HKMG buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics).

The cell lysate was precleared using streptavidin-agarose beads (GE Healthcare), incubated with biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the wild-type or mutated RUNX binding sites, and polydeoxyinosinicdeoxycytidylic acid (Sigma-Aldrich).

A combination of all three oligonucleotides containing the mutated or the wild-type binding sites was used in the assay.

DNA-bound proteins were collected with streptavidin-agarose beads, washed with HKMG buffer, and finally resuspended in NuPAGE loading buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), heated to 70degreesC for 10 min, and separated on a NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen Life Technologies).

The proteins were electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare) and detected using RUNX1 or RUNX3 antibodies described in the previous section.
