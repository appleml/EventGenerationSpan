Promoter enzyme immuno assay.

As performed in the pull-down assay, HEK293T cells were transfected with RUNX1 or RUNX3 and subsequently lysed.

Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation.

384-well plates, precoated with streptavidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were washed 3 times with washing buffer (PBS and 0.05% Tween 20).

Biotinylated FOXP3 promoter/oligonucleotides probes containing the RUNX binding sites were added (1 pmol per well; 50 fmol/microl) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature.

Either a combination of all three oligonucleotides containing the mutated or the wild-type binding sites was used or single oligonucleotides were used in the assay.

After 3 washing steps with washing buffer, the nuclear extract was added (concentration > 0.2 microg/microl) and incubated overnight at 4degreesC.

The lysates were incubated with 10 microg of poly-deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid (Sigma-Aldrich).

The plate was washed with HKMG buffer and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-RUNX1 (ab11903, Abcam) or 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-RUNX3 (H-50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4degreesC for 2 h.

# T6 Protein S9 146 151 1063 1068 RUNX3

After three washing steps with HKMG buffer, a secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG-HRP, 1:3,000 in HKMG buffer, Cell Signaling Technology) was added, and the plate was incubated for 1 h at 4degreesC.

The wells were washed 4 times with HKMG buffer before adding the substrate reagent (R&D Systems).

The colorimetric reaction was stopped by adding 2 M H2SO4.

Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Berthold Technologies).
