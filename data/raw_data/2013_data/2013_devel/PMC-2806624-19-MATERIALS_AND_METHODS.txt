Western blotting.

For human RUNX1 and RUNX3 analysis on the protein level, 106 cells were lysed and loaded next to a protein-mass ladder (Invitrogen) on a NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen).

The proteins were electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare).

Unspecific binding was blocked with 3% milk in TBS Tween, and the membranes were subsequently incubated with a 1:1,000 dilution of rabbit anti-RUNX1 (ab11903; Abcam) or 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-RUNX3 (H-50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in blocking buffer containing 3% milk in TBS Tween overnight at 4degreesC.

The blots were developed using an anti-rabbit IgG HRP-labeled mAb (Cell Signaling Technology) and visualized with a LAS-1000 gel documentation system (Fujifilm).

To confirm sample loading and transfer membranes were incubated in stripping buffer and reblocked for 1 h and reprobed using anti-GAPDH (6C5; Ambion) and developed using an anti-mouse IgG HRP-labeled mAb (Cell Signaling Technology).
