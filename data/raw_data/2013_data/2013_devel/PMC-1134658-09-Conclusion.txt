In conclusion, our results show that BMP-6 induces activation of intracellular Smad signalling in mature human B-cells with consecutive production of Id1 protein.
# T1 Protein S1 37 42 37 42 BMP-6
# T2 Protein S1 150 153 150 153 Id1
$ T2 Protein S1 150 153 150 153 Id1
@ T7 Positive_regulation S1 124 135 124 135 consecutive
@ T8 Gene_expression S1 136 146 136 146 production
% E1 Positive_regulation:T7 Theme:E2
% E2 Gene_expression:T8 Theme:T2

Furthermore, we report that BMP-6 has an antiproliferative effect in B cells stimulated with anti-IgM alone or the combined action of anti-IgM and CD40L.
# T3 Protein S2 28 33 191 196 BMP-6
# T4 Protein S2 147 152 310 315 CD40L

Additionally, BMP-6 induces cell death in activated memory B cells and Ramos cells.
# T5 Protein S3 14 19 331 336 BMP-6

Taken together, these results provide a rationale to further examine the role of BMP-6 signalling in normal B cell biology as well as in pathologic conditions like B cell malignancies and autoimmune disorders.
# T6 Protein S4 81 86 482 487 BMP-6
