Degraded CGN activated the NF-kB pathway in monocytes.

A: THP-1 cells were transfected with a NF-kappaB reporter plasmid driving expression of luciferase.
# T1 Protein S2 88 98 143 153 luciferase
$ T1 Protein S2 88 98 143 153 luciferase
@ T9 Positive_regulation S2 66 73 121 128 driving
@ T10 Gene_expression S2 74 84 129 139 expression
% E1 Positive_regulation:T9 Theme:E2
% E2 Gene_expression:T10 Theme:T1

Cells were then treated with various concentrations of 10 kDa (triangles), or 40 kDa dCGN (squares).

B: THP-1 cells treated with 1 mg/ml of 10 kDa dCGN (C10), or with 1 mg/ml of 40 kDa dCGN (C40) were lysed after various periods of time.

Proteins in cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then Western blotted for IkappaBalpha or alpha-tubulin as loading control.
# T2 Protein S5 81 93 474 486 IkappaBalpha

C: Degraded carrageenans (dCGN) induced activation of NF-kappaB.

THP-1 cells were treated with nothing (control), or with 1 mg/ml of 10 kDa dCGN (C10), or with 1 mg/ml of 40 kDa dCGN (C40) for 30 minutes at 37degreesC.

Nuclei were isolated and lysed.

Proteins in nuclear extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then Western blotted for NF-kappaB p50 subunit (p50) or NF-kappaB p65 subunit (p65).
# T3 Protein S9 94 97 869 872 p50
# T4 Protein S9 107 110 882 885 p50
# T5 Protein S9 125 128 900 903 p65
# T6 Protein S9 138 141 913 916 p65

Lower panels show Western blots of nuclear ERK revealing equivalent amount of protein in each sample.

Data are representative of three separate experiments.

D: Degraded carrageenan (dCGN) induced activation of NF-kappaB.

Nuclei isolated from THP-1 cells were fluorescence-stained for NF-kappaB p50 subunit or NF-kappaB p65 subunit before (filled area) or after cells were treated with 1 mg/ml of 10 kDa dCGN (C10), or with 1 mg/ml of 40 kDa dCGN (C40) for 30 minutes at 37degreesC.
# T7 Protein S13 73 76 1213 1216 p50
# T8 Protein S13 98 101 1238 1241 p65

Dashed line corresponds to nuclei stained only with secondary fluorescence antibody.

Fluorescence intensity was analyzed by flow cytometry as described.
