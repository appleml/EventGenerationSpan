(A) A3.01 T cells were cotransfected with pGL3-Basic reporter plasmid containing the 1025 bp A3G promoter and 1 microg of Vif expression plasmid, 1 microg Tat expression plasmid or increasing amounts of HIV-1NL4-3 (0.1, 0.5 and 1 microg).

(B) A3.01 T cells were transiently transfected with pGL3-Basic reporter plasmid containing the 1025 bp A3G promoter or with empty vector.
# T8 Protein S5 103 106 588 591 A3G

Fifteen hour before harvesting for luciferase assay, a subset of the cell culture was stimulated with 20 ng/ml TPA.

Forty-eight hour after transfection, luciferase assay was performed.
# T10 Protein S7 37 47 776 786 luciferase

Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to coexpressed renilla luciferase activities and the values for the empty vectors (untreated and TPA-stimulated) were set as 1.
