Each bar represents the mean+/-SEM of at least three independent experiments; *** p<0.001 compared with control as determined by ANOVA/Newman-Keuls analysis.

(C and D) Co-immunoprecipitation analyses of PBMCs from steroid-naive asthma patients treated with inhaled FP (500 microg via a spacer) in vivo demonstrated decreased association between GATA-3 and importin-alpha.

The individual values for each treatment are presented graphically.

(E) Representative Western blot showing that importin-alpha expression was unaffected by inhalation of FP.

Blot is representative of gels from three participants.
