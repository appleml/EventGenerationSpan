Isolation and growth of B cells.

Splenocytes were prepared by homogenizing spleen tissue with two frosted slides and debris was filtered through a 100-mum cell strainer.

Erythrocytes were lysed using 0.8% ammonium chloride solution (StemCell Technologies) for 10 min on ice and washed twice with PBS.

B cells were isolated using CD19-MACS beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec) and grown in Iscove's medium supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic/antimycotic (GIBCO).
# T1 Protein S4 28 32 329 333 CD19

Splenocytes isolated from SCID-passaged lymphomas consisted of 80%-90% B cells as determined by flow cytometry, and were hence not further purified with CD19-MACS beads.
# T2 Protein S5 153 157 684 688 CD19

Splenocytes were seeded at 1.25 x 106 cells/ml and where applicable, recombinant mouse IL4 was added at 100 ng/ml, recombinant mouse IL10 at 10 ng/ml, and rat IgG1 anti-mouse IL10 and rat IgG1 isotype control at 10 mug/ml (R&D Systems).
# T3 Protein S6 87 90 788 791 IL4
# T4 Protein S6 133 137 834 838 IL10
# T5 Protein S6 175 179 876 880 IL10

For BrdU incorporation assays, splenocytes were pulsed for 24 h with 10 muM BrdU 1 d post-harvest.
