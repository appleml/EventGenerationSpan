Constructs and transfection

The complementary DNA (cDNA) of the mouse Sharpin gene was cloned and amplified from RAW264.7 RNA extracts.
# T1 Protein S2 42 49 70 77 Sharpin

The primer sequences were forward, 5'-CC ATG GCG ATG TCG CCG CCC GCC GGC GGT; reverse, 5'- AAG CTT CTA GGT GGA AGC TGC AGC AAG A.

The Sharpin cDNA was cloned into expression vector pFLAG-CMV-2.
# T2 Protein S4 4 11 270 277 Sharpin

Murine fibroblasts and macrophages were were used to express recombinant SHARPIN protein.
# T3 Protein S5 73 80 403 410 SHARPIN

Cells (2x104) were seeded in 96-well treated plates the day before transfection.

After overnight incubation, 200 ng pFLAG-SHARPIN plasmids were transfected with 0.5 ul Lipofectamine 2000.
# T4 Protein S7 41 48 542 549 SHARPIN

24 hours later, cells were incubated with fresh culture medium.

After another 24 hours, cells were lysed to confirm the FLAG-SHARPIN expression by immunoblots with anti-FLAG.

Cells with no transfection and transfected with empty vector pFLAG-CMV-2 were used as negative control in all transfection experiments.
