Inhibition of PKC or NF-kappaB induces apoptosis in MDMs.

(A) MDMs were pre-incubated in RPMI medium containing inhibitors (Ro-31-8220: 5 microM, Go-6976: 5 microM, BAPTA/AM: 2.5 microM) for 30 minutes prior to the addition of M-CSF.

As a control, untreated cells were incubated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibody recognizing the active cleaved form of caspase-3.

The blots were reblotted with beta-actin that served as a loading control.
# T1 Protein S5 30 40 462 472 beta-actin

The ratio of active caspase-3 bands (17 kD and 19 kD) to beta-actin control was determined by densitometry analysis (bottom panel).
# T2 Protein S6 20 29 527 536 caspase-3
# T3 Protein S6 57 67 564 574 beta-actin
$ T2 Protein S6 20 29 527 536 caspase-3
@ T6 Positive_regulation S6 13 19 520 526 active

Data represents the mean +/- S.E.M from two independent donors.

(B) Apoptosis of the treated MDMs was also measured by Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodine (PI) staining and analyzed by flow cytometry.
# T4 Protein S8 55 64 758 767 Annexin V

The percentage of surviving cells (Annexin V/PI negative) for the cells treated with vehicle/M-CSF was arbitrarily set as 100.
# T5 Protein S9 35 44 875 884 Annexin V
$ T5 Protein S9 35 44 875 884 Annexin V
@ T7 Negative_regulation S9 48 56 888 896 negative
% E2 Negative_regulation:T7 Theme:T5

Data shown represent the mean +/- S.E.M from three independent experiments.

*The p-values of inhibitors/M-CSF compared to vehicle/M-CSF were <=0.05.
