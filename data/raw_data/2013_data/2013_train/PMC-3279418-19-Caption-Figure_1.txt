In vivo and in vitro features of SHARPIN.

(A) COILS and MotifScan programs were used to predict the presence of CC (coiled-coil) domain, UBL (ubiquitin-like) domain and ZFRBP (zinc-finger Ran-Binding protein 2) domain which form similar motif patterns in the SHARPIN protein of human, mouse and rat origins.
# T2 Protein S2 217 224 259 266 SHARPIN

(B) Eight week-old females of WT and cpdm mice.

The mutant mice (above) develop progressive skin inflammation starting at about four weeks.

(C) Extramedullary hematopoiesis causes marked enlargement of the spleen of cpdm mice.

(D) BMDC were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml LPS for 4 hours.

The mRNA level of Sharpin was measured by qRT-PCR and presented relative to the mRNA expression in non-stimulated WT BMDC.

Bars represent the mean +/- s.d. of 3 mice.

* P<0.05; ** P<0.001.

(E) Fibroblast (NIH3T3) and macrophages (RAW264.7) cells were transfected with the expression plasmid pFLAG-SHARPIN.
# T4 Protein S10 108 115 913 920 SHARPIN

After 48 hours, cells were fixed and probed with anti-FLAG and FITC-conjugated secondary antibody.

Nuclei were stained with DAPI.

In both transfected cell lines, FLAG-SHARPIN was found to be cytoplasm-localized.
