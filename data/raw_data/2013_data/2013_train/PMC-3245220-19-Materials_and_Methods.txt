Annexin V/PI Apoptosis Assay
# T1 Protein S1 0 9 0 9 Annexin V

Cell apoptosis assay was performed as described previously [51] using the Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA).
# T2 Protein S2 74 83 103 112 Annexin V

Briefly, human monocytes (5x106) were incubated with inhibitors for 30 minutes in X-vivo medium and restimulated with 100 ng/ml M-CSF overnight.

The cells were removed from the culture dish using Accutase (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD PharMingen).
# T3 Protein S4 106 115 425 434 Annexin V

Annexin V-FITC and PI double negative cells were considered non-apoptotic cells for statistical analysis.
# T4 Protein S5 0 9 508 517 Annexin V
