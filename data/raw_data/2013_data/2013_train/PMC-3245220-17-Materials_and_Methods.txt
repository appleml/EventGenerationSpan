Transient Transfection of Primary Human Monocytes

Monocytes were transfected using the human monocyte Amaxa nucleofector kit (Lonza Walkersville Inc, Walkersville, MD) as previously described [51].

Briefly, monocytes were resuspended in Amaxa Nucleofactor solution at a density of 20x106 cells/ml, and 2 microg of total plasmid DNA 100 nM of PKCalpha siRNA or control siRNA was added and transfected using program Amaxa Y-01.
# T1 Protein S3 144 158 342 356 PKCalpha siRNA

For co-transfection studies, PKCalpha or NF-kappaB p65 constructs were mixed at a ratio of 5:1 with the reporter plasmid.
# T2 Protein S4 29 37 455 463 PKCalpha
# T3 Protein S4 51 54 477 480 p65

Immediately after transfection, cells were washed with 1 ml of RPMI medium containing 2 mM glutamine and 10% FBS or serum free LGM medium (Lonza Walkersville Inc.) then plated at 4x105 cells/well in 24-well plates.

The original medium was replaced by serum free LGM medium without or with M-CSF (100 ng/ml) one hour later.

The next day, cell-free supernatants were collected for the SEAP analysis.

Cells were stained with Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI).
# T4 Protein S8 24 33 970 979 Annexin V

For the inhibition studies, cells were pre-incubated with inhibitor for 30 minutes in X-vivo medium prior to the addition of M-CSF.
