A GC-box mediates transcriptional activity of the 180 bp core promoter.

(A) A3.01 T cells were transfected with reporter plasmid pGL3-Basic containing 180, 150 or 120 bp of the A3G promoter.
# T1 Protein S2 105 108 177 180 A3G

The two G-to-T substitutions introduced into the GC-box of the 180 bp fragment (180mut) are specified.

After 48 h, cells were harvested for luciferase assay.
# T2 Protein S4 37 47 331 341 luciferase

Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to coexpressed renilla luciferase activities.
# T3 Protein S5 8 18 357 367 luciferase
# T4 Protein S5 69 79 418 428 luciferase

Mean values (+/-SD) of a representative experiment performed in triplicate are shown.

(B) pGL3-Promoter reporter plasmids containing the regions E1 or E2 (see Figure 1) upstream of the SV40 promoter were transfected into A3.01 T cells.

Firefly luciferase activities after 48 h were normalized to coexpressed renilla luciferase activities.
