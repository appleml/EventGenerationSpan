Multiplex cytokine assay

Quantification of the levels of cytokines IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF and the chemokine CXCL8 was performed on culture supernatants using multiplexed biomarker immunoassay kits according to manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).
# T1 Protein S2 42 46 67 71 IL-2
# T2 Protein S2 48 52 73 77 IL-6
# T3 Protein S2 54 59 79 84 IL-10
# T4 Protein S2 86 91 111 116 CXCL8

A Bio-Plex(TM) 200 readout System was used (Bio-Rad), which utilizes Luminex(R) xMAP(TM) fluorescent bead-based technology (Luminex Corp., Austin).

Levels were automatically calculated from standard curves using Bio-Plex Manager software (v.4.1.1, Bio-Rad).
