Inhibition of M-CSF-induced PKC reduces NF-kappaB-regulated genes in both MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells.

MDMs (A and C) and RAW 264.7 (B) cells were pretreated with Ro-31-8220 or solvent control DMSO for 30 minutes prior to M-CSF stimulation for the indicated times.

Total RNA was isolated and converted to cDNA.

Real-time RT PCR was performed using primers for IkappaBalpha, BCL-xl or GAPDH.
# T1 Protein S4 49 61 357 369 IkappaBalpha
# T2 Protein S4 63 69 371 377 BCL-xl

Data are expressed as relative fold increase of IkappaBalpha or BCL-xl gene expression upon treatment over non-stimulated cells.
