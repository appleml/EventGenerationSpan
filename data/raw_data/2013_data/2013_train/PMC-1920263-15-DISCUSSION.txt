Shortly after the discovery of APOBEC3G, it became clear that this human gene plays an important role in antiretroviral defense (4).

Originally identified as a restriction factor of HIV-1 infection, expression of APOBEC3G was found in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and macrophages, which represent the main target cells for HIV-1 (32).

This observation is consistent with the fact that the gene appears to lack canonical CCAAT and TATA boxes (32), a condition often associated with multiple transcriptional start sites (49-51).

However, one single start site was detected in 6 of 19 clones and was designated as +1.

This TSS is located 66 bp upstream of the start of the published mRNA sequence (GenBank(TM) NM021822).

We cloned a 1025 bp promoter, which ranges from position -959/+66 relative to the identified TSS.

Luciferase reporter assays showed that this promoter was transcriptionally active in A3.01 T cells.

Treatment with the phorbol ester TPA did not further enhance transcriptional activity, although upregulation of A3G mRNA levels in T cells by TPA has been described (33).

However, the promoter analysis we performed indicates a different mechanism that is independent of transcriptional regulation.

In addition, we observed that the A3G promoter was not inducible by IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma in A3.01 T cells, whereas in the hepatic cell line HepG2, a moderate induction was measured.

In this context, two interferon-responsive elements have been identified at the positions -6/+9 and +1/+15 relative to the TSS (48).

Consistent with this data, we observed an interferon induction in hepatocytes for the fragments ranging between 1025 and 120 bp length.

This is surprising, since IFN-alpha-inducible signaling cascades are present in A3.01 T cells: we showed that the control plasmid harboring interferon-responsive GAS elements was markedly induced by IFN-alpha treatment.
# T12 Protein S22 26 35 2743 2752 IFN-alpha
# T13 Protein S22 199 208 2916 2925 IFN-alpha

In contrast, the GAS element was not responsive to IFN-gamma treatment in these cells, suggesting that our T cell line was not able to mediate IFN-gamma-induced signals.
# T14 Protein S23 51 60 2988 2997 IFN-gamma
# T15 Protein S23 143 152 3080 3089 IFN-gamma

So far, enhanced A3G promoter activity by interferons is clearly described in hepatocytes and macrophages, whereas the situation in T cells is still unclear.

This observation is not contradictory to our results since T cell lines are mitotically active and therefore rather in an activated than in a resting state.

In conclusion, the current data suggests that regulation of the A3G promoter activity by interferons is dependent on the cell type and possibly also from the cellular activation status.

We additionally analyzed the influence of HIV-1 proteins on A3G promoter activity.

By generating a series of 5' deletions, we showed that the core promoter is located within the region -114/+66 relative to the TSS.

This 180 bp promoter was transcriptionally active in the lymphoid, myeloid and hepatic cell lines we tested, indicating that ubiquitous transcription factors are involved in regulation of A3G gene transcription.

A GC-box with the sequence TGGGCGGGAC was identified at position -87/-78 of the A3G promoter.
# T37 Protein S38 80 83 5117 5120 A3G

This GC-box is essential for basal promoter activity, since changing the motif to TGTTCGGGAC by introducing two point mutations strongly reduced A3G promoter activity.

# T39 Protein S39 145 148 5276 5279 A3G

The transcriptional potency of the GC-box was further demonstrated by cloning it upstream of an SV40 promoter.

This resulted in a 4-fold enhanced transcription rate.

The hypothesis that a general transcription factor is involved in regulation of A3G transcription was confirmed by EMSA.

The 180-bp core promoter region, which we identified for A3G has 100% identity with the A3F sequence.

# T70 Protein S57 88 91 7756 7759 A3F

Therefore, Sp1/Sp3 transcription factors are most likely also mediating basal transcription of the A3F gene.

Our study revealed that the human A3G gene is controlled by a promoter with multiple transcriptional start sites.

In A3.01 T cells, the A3G promoter appears constitutively active and is not inducible by TPA, type I or II interferons or by HIV-1 proteins.

The core promoter is located within a region of 180 bp at position -114/+66 relative to the TSS.

A GC-box is crucial to the function of the core promoter and represents a binding site for Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors.

Our results can serve as a basis for future studies aimed at understanding how A3G and A3F expression is controlled in different tissues and how these restriction factors can be used to develop novel therapeutic strategies against HIV-1 infection.
