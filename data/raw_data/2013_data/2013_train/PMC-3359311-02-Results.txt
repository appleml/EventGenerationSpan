The inflammasomes and their respective activators examined in this study are listed in Table 1.

Cells were stimulated in accordance with the schedule in Figure 1.

In CF, airway epithelial cells have been shown to possess a hyper-inflammatory phenotype and produce an exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine response [4], [5].

To determine if airway epithelial cells contribute to the increased IL-1beta production in patients with CF, CF and control bronchial epithelial cell lines were stimulated with the inflammasome inducers P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 (PAO1) and LPS followed by ATP.

IL-1beta levels in cell culture supernatants were not greatly increased in either the CF or control cell lines (Fig. 2a-d), although a small increase in IL-1beta production was detected in NuLi-1 and CuFi-1 cells, but not in S9 and IB3-1 cells, by 24 hours.

In contrast, these airway cells were highly responsive to other inflammatory stimuli, such as recombinant IL-1beta, producing large quantities of IL-8 (Fig. 2a-d inserts).
