Pseudotyped virions and single round infection

293T cells (1 x 107) were transfected with pNL4-3.

Luc.R-E- or pNL4-3.

FLAG-Tat.
# T1 Protein S4 5 8 121 124 Tat

R-E- (10 microg) together with pHXB2 Env (10 microg), and 48-h post-transfection cell supernatant was collected.
# T2 Protein S5 37 40 162 165 Env

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using anti-p24 antibody measured virion concentration.

PBMCs, Jurkat or U937 cells (5 x 107) were infected with HXB2 Env-pseudotyped virions (500 ng of p24) by spinoculation, as previously described (50).
# T3 Protein S7 62 65 397 400 Env
# T4 Protein S7 97 100 432 435 p24
