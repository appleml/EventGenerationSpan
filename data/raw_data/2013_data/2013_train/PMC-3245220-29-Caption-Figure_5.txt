M-CSF-induced PKC activity does not regulate IkappaBalpha degradation but regulates the phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 at Ser276.

(A) MDMs were pretreated with cycloheximide (CHX) in the absence or presence of Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes prior to M-CSF stimulation for the indicated times.

Whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting with anti-IkappaBalpha antibody.

Data are representative of three independent experiments.

(B) MDMs were pretreated with either vehicle or Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes before the addition of M-CSF for 10 minutes.

Whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and phospho-Ser276 or phospho-Ser536 of NF-kappaB p65 was detected using phospho-specific antibodies to either residue of NF-kappaB p65.

(C) Whole cell lysates of RAW 264.7 cells treated with vehicle control or Ro-31-8220 in the absence or presence of M-CSF were subjected to Western blot analysis with phospho-Ser276 or phospho-Ser536 NF-kappaB p65 antibodies.

(D) Cytosolic and nuclear fractions of RAW 264.7 were obtained from the treated cells and immunoblotted for phospho-NF-kappaB.

The purity of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions was confirmed by immunoblotting with GAPDH and Lamin B, respectively.

Shown are representative blots from three independent experiments.
