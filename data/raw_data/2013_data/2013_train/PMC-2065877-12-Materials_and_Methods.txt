MTS assay.

The 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt (MTS) cell cytotoxicity/proliferation assays were performed using the CellTiter 96 aqueous one-solution cell proliferation assay (Promega), according to manufacturer's instructions.

For IL4 studies, splenocytes were cultured for 3 d in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml IL4.
# T1 Protein S3 4 7 302 305 IL4
# T2 Protein S3 91 94 389 392 IL4

Cells were seeded on day 3 in triplicate in a 96-well plate at 2.5 x 106 cells/ml at 100 mul per well.

MTS reagent was added for 4 h and absorbance was read at 540 nm; values plotted were subtracted from blanks.

For neutralization assays, splenocytes were seeded at 5 x 106 cells/ml at 100 mul per well on day of harvest and IL4, rat IgG1 anti-mouse IL4, or rat IgG1 isotype control (R&D Systems) were added at the concentrations indicated in the figures.
# T3 Protein S6 113 116 719 722 IL4
# T4 Protein S6 138 141 744 747 IL4

Cultures were pulsed for 4 h with MTS reagent 1 d post-seeding.

For inhibitor studies, splenocytes were seeded at 1 x 107 cells/ml at 100 mul per well on day of harvest, and inhibitors were added at the concentrations indicated in the figures.

The inhibitors BAY11-7085, rapamycin, triciribine, U0126, SB202190, and cucurbitacin I were purchased from EMD Biosciences.

For non-malignant splenocyte cultures, B cell activation was induced with 10 mug/ml of goat F(ab') anti-mouse IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch).

Cultures were pulsed for 4 h with MTS reagent 1 d post-seeding.
