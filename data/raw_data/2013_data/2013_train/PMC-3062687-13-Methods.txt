Plasmid Constructs

The Flag-IKKbeta (SSEE), Flag-IKKbeta (SSAA), and HA-IkappaBalpha (SSAA) constructs were provided by C. Wu (NCI, Bethesda) and U. Siebenlist (NIAID, Bethesda), respectively.
# T1 Protein S2 4 23 23 42 Flag-IKKbeta (SSEE)
# T2 Protein S2 25 44 44 63 Flag-IKKbeta (SSAA)
# T3 Protein S2 50 72 69 91 HA-IkappaBalpha (SSAA)

The HA-IkappaBalpha and IKKbeta (K44A)-Flag plasmids were purchased from Addgene44, 45.
# T4 Protein S3 4 19 197 212 HA-IkappaBalpha
# T5 Protein S3 24 43 217 236 IKKbeta (K44A)-Flag

The Flag-RPS3, GST-RPS3, HA-RPS3, VN-HA, NleH1-HA plasmids were described previously6, 9.
# T6 Protein S4 4 13 285 294 Flag-RPS3
# T7 Protein S4 15 23 296 304 GST-RPS3
# T8 Protein S4 25 32 306 313 HA-RPS3
# T9 Protein S4 34 39 315 320 VN-HA
# T10 Protein S4 41 49 322 330 NleH1-HA

The point mutants of RPS3 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick Change Kit (Stratagene) with primers forward 5'-CTGCCTGACCACGTGGCCATTGTGGAACCCAAA-3' and reverse 5'-TTTGGGTTCCACAATGGCCACGTGGTCAGGCAG-3' for S209A.
# T11 Protein S5 21 25 392 396 RPS3

All mutants were verified by DNA sequencing.
