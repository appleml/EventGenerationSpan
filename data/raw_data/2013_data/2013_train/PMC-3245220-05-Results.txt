M-CSF-Induces PKCalpha Kinase Activity
# T1 Protein S1 14 22 14 22 PKCalpha

Since our data suggested that conventional PKCs were involved in activating NF-kappaB in response to M-CSF in primary human macrophages, we next investigated whether the conventional PKC, PKCalpha was a downstream target of M-CSF in human MDMs.

PKCalpha was immunoprecipitated from human MDMs at the indicated time points (Figure 4), and then a PKC kinase assay was performed using a fluorescein-tagged peptide as a substrate.

As shown in Figure 4 (upper panel), the peptide substrate was maximally phosphorylated within 10 minutes of stimulation (1.8-fold over resting cells, lower panel), and then returned to basal levels by 15 minutes.

This effect was not seen in M-CSF-stimulated monocytes when isogenic antibodies (IgG) were used for immunoprecipitation.

Western blots of identical samples using an antibody recognizing PKCalpha demonstrated that equal amounts of PKCalpha were assayed (Figure 4, middle panel).
