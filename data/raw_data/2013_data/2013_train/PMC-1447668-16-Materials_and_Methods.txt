Real-time PCR.

Real-time PCR analysis of HTLV-I (Tax) proviral load was performed as previously described [47,50].
# T1 Protein S2 34 37 49 52 Tax

DNA was extracted from 1 x 106 cells using Puregene DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States), and 100 ng of the sample DNA solution was analyzed by this system.

The HTLV-I proviral DNA load was calculated by the following formula: copy number of HTLV-I (pX) per 100 cells = (copy number of pX)/(copy number of beta-actin/2) x 100.
# T2 Protein S4 149 159 450 460 beta-actin
