Real-time PCR.

PCR primers and probes were designed based on the sequences reported in GenBank with the Primer Express software version 1.2 (Applied Biosystems) as follows: FOXP3 forward primer, 5'-GAAACAGCACATTCCCAGAGTTC-3'; FOXP3 reverse primer, 5'-ATGGCCCAGCGGATGAG-3'; EF-1a forward primer, 5'-CTGAACCATCCAGGCCAAAT-3'; and EF-1a reverse primer, 5'-GCCGTGTGGCAATCCAAT-3', as previously described (Mantel et al., 2007).

The prepared cDNAs were amplified using SYBR green PCR master mix (Fermentas) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer in an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems).

RUNX1 and RUNX3 mRNA was detected by using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays from Applied Biosystems and used according to the manufacturer's instruction using TaqMan master mix using a 7000 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems).

Relative quantification and calculation of the range of confidence was performed using the comparative deltadeltaCT method (Applied Biosystems).

The percentage of FOXP3 mRNA in siRNA-mediated RUNX knockdown cells was calculated in relation to cells, which were transfected with scrambled control siRNA.
