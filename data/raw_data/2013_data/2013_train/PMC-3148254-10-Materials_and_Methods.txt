Retroviral transduction

A retroviral vector (pMIP) was used for the stable transduction of cells with HOIP and IKKgamma cDNA constructs.
# T1 Protein S2 78 82 102 106 HOIP
# T2 Protein S2 87 95 111 119 IKKgamma

pMIP was constructed by replacing the IRES and GFP encoding sequences in pMIG [31] with the IRES and puromycin resistance gene from pIRESpuro2 (Clontech).

FLAG-tagged mouse HOIP cDNA was inserted into the multiple cloning site of pMIP.
# T3 Protein S4 18 22 310 314 HOIP

A pMIP construct encoding mouse IKKgamma with an amino terminal birch profilin peptide (BP)-tag was also prepared.
# T4 Protein S5 32 40 405 413 IKKgamma

Retroviral particles were generated by transient transfection of 293T cells with pMIP, pMIP-HOIP, or pMIP-IKKgamma and the packaging vector pCL-Eco [32].
# T5 Protein S6 92 96 580 584 HOIP
# T6 Protein S6 106 114 594 602 IKKgamma

Two days after transfection, culture supernatants were harvested and filtered.

A20.2J or HOIP-deficient cells were added to 24-well plates (2.5x105 cells/well) with 1 ml virus-containing supernatant and 8 microg/ml polybrene.

Plates were centrifuged at 500 x g for 2 hrs at room temperature.

Cells were cultured in B cell culture medium for 48 hrs, after which the transduced cells were selected in 3 microg/ml puromycin.
