In vitro methylation and reporter gene assays

The IRF-4 promoter-reporter gene construct was generously provided by J. Hiscott (31).
# T1 Protein S2 4 9 50 55 IRF-4

Constructs were methylated in vitro with CpG Methylase (M.Sss I) as recommended by the manufacturer (NE Biolabs) and complete methylation was checked via restriction analysis (Figure 5A).
# T2 Protein S3 41 54 174 187 CpG Methylase
# T3 Protein S3 56 63 189 196 M.Sss I

Reporter gene assays using the dual luciferase assay (Promega) were performed similar to previous reports (29).
# T4 Protein S4 36 46 357 367 luciferase

Briefly, 5 nM of the reporter construct and the transfection control construct expressing the renilla luciferase gene were transientlyco-expressed via electroporation.

The control construct served as an internal reference for transfection efficiency.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, luciferase activity was measured with a LB 96 P microlumat (EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany).
# T6 Protein S7 38 48 722 732 luciferase

IRF-4 promoter activation was quantified as a ratio of measured firefly light units (flu) relative to renilla (rlu).
# T7 Protein S8 0 5 820 825 IRF-4

Each experiment was carried out at least three times.
