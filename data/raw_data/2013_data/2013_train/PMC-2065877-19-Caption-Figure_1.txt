(A) Lymphomas are identified with a number (1-7).

Arrows indicate the LMP1-specific band and its degradation products as well as a non-specific band.

Actin was used as a loading control.

(B) White and red pulps are shown, but this architecture is lost upon development of lymphoma.

Scale bar, 20 mum.
