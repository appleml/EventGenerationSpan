Tat enhances the NF-kappaB activity following PMA stimulation by associating with IkappaB-alpha and counteracting the NF-kappaB repression.

HeLa cells (5 x 106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat or p3xFLAG empty vector (5 microg), and 48 h later were stimulated with PMA (5 min, 20 ng/ml) or left unstimulated, washed twice with DMEM and harvested at the indicated times.

Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared for further analysis.

(A) Nuclear extracts were analysed for the p65, p50 and FLAG-Tat binding to the NF-kappaB double-stranded oligonucleotide using the NF-kappaB Transcription Factor ELISA assay kit (Cayman).

(B) Nuclear and cytosolic extracts (20 microg) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and analysed by western blotting using the anti-p65, anti-FLAG, anti-Histone H1, anti-IkappaB-alpha and anti-Hexokinase-II antibodies.

Densitometry values (D) of the bands were expressed as fold increase above the control (lane 1).

(C) IKK activity was measured in cytosolic extracts (100 microg) by using HTScan IKK kinase assay (Cell Signaling Technology).

(D) HeLa cells (5 x 106) were transfected with or without p3xFLAG-Tat (5 microg); 48 h later, cells were stimulated with PMA (5 min, 20 ng/ml) or left unstimulated, washed twice with DMEM, and harvested after 240 min.

Whole cell extracts (1 mg) were immunoprecipitated with protein G-Sepharose-coupled anti-IkappaB-alpha antibody.

Immunocomplexes were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and analysed by western blotting with anti-p65, anti-FLAG and anti-IkappaB-alpha antibodies.

Densitometry values (D) of the bands were expressed as fold increase above the control (lane 1).

Values (mean +/- SE, n = 3) are shown.
