In vitro methylation of an IRF-4 promoter-reporter construct decreases its activity
# T1 Protein S1 27 32 27 32 IRF-4

To provide evidence for a direct effect of methylational status on IRF-4 promoter activity we performed reporter gene assays with IRF-4 promoter constructs before and after their in vitro methylation.
# T2 Protein S2 67 72 151 156 IRF-4
# T3 Protein S2 130 135 214 219 IRF-4

A complete methylation of these constructs was checked via restriction assays with methylation-sensitive endonucleases (Figure 5A).

Intriguingly, methylation of the IRF-4 promoter significantly decreased promoter activity in IRF-4-positive SD-1 cells by 85.0% (Figure 5B).

The silencing effect of CpG methylation was not restricted to IRF-4-positive cells, since in vitro methylation led to a 92.9% abrogation of promoter activity in IRF-4-negative Jurkat cells (Figure 5C).

In contrast, control methylation of a reporter construct with a different promoter (FasL) as well as an empty vector had no effect on the reporter activity (data not shown).

These data proved a direct association between methylation and activity of the IRF-4 promoter.
