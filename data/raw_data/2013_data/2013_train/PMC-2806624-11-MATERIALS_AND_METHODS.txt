Immunohistochemistry.

Human tonsils were obtained from tonsillectomy samples of hypertrophic and obstructive tonsils without a current infection.

Ethical permission was obtained from Cantonal Ethics Commission, and informed consent was obtained from patients.

Paraformaldehyde-fixed tonsil cryosections were stained with unconjugated rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody to human RUNX1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or unconjugated mouse IgG1 mAb to human RUNX3 (Abcam).
# T1 Protein S4 114 119 374 379 RUNX1
# T2 Protein S4 193 198 453 458 RUNX3

After a washing step, the sections were stained with the corresponding secondary antibodies.

RUNX1-binding antibodies were detected by using Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and RUNX3-binding antibodies were detected by using Alexa Fluor 532-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1.
# T3 Protein S6 0 5 561 566 RUNX1
# T4 Protein S6 100 105 661 666 RUNX3
$ T3 Protein S6 0 5 561 566 RUNX1

Afterward, the sections were washed and in the case of RUNX3 staining a blocking step with an unconjugated mouse IgG1 mAb was used.
# T5 Protein S7 55 60 813 818 RUNX3

Finally, the sections were stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated mouse IgG1 mAb to human FOXP3 (eBioscience) or the corresponding isotype control.
# T6 Protein S8 91 96 981 986 FOXP3

Tissue sections were stained with DAPI for the demonstration of nuclei and mounted with Prolong antifade (Invitrogen).

Images were acquired and analyzed using the confocal microscope DMI 4000B and the TCS SPE system (both from Leica).
