GLepsilon transcript assay
# T1 Protein S1 0 9 0 9 GLepsilon

The CD40-simulated activation of GLepsilon transcription was evaluated as previously reported [33].

Briefly, 1x106 cells were stimulated overnight with anti-CD40 antibody (10 microg/ml) or an isotype control antibody, with or without 500 U/ml mouse IL-4 (BD Biosciences).
# T4 Protein S3 149 153 276 280 IL-4

RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen), and reverse-transcribed (Superscript III kit, Invitrogen).

Quantitative PCR for GLepsilon and Hprt1 was performed using SYBR GREEN master mix (Applied Biosystems), and an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR instrument.
# T5 Protein S5 21 30 423 432 GLepsilon
# T6 Protein S5 35 40 437 442 Hprt1

Expression of GLepsilon in each sample was normalized to the expression of Hprt1.
