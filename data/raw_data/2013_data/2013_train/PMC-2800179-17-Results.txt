In order to study the effect of dCGN on the expression of cell surface antigens, PBM and THP-1 cells were incubated for 36 h in the presence and absence of dCGN.

The expression of various cell surface molecules was analyzed by flow cytometry as described in materials and methods.

Both forms of dCGN clearly stimulated expression of ICAM-1 (CD54) on PBM and THP-1 cells (Fig. 4A).

The increase in ICAM-1 expression was higher on THP-1 cells treated with 40 kDa dCGN (Fig. 4B).

Another surface antigen, the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (CD58) was slightly reduced on PBM after treatment with 40 kDa dCGN (Fig. 4B).

Interestingly, expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules of class I (HLA-ABC) and of class II (HLA-DR), as well as the monocyte marker CD14, seemed to be reduced by treatment with dCGN (Fig. 4B).

However, these differences were not statistically significant.

Treatment with dCGN also induced a strong aggregation of monocytes, detected by phase contrast inverse microscopy (Fig. 5).

Although this effect was easily observed in monocytes incubated with the 10 kDa dCGN (Fig. 5B), a more robust cell aggregation was observed in monocytes incubated with the 40 kDa dCGN (Fig. 5C).

ICAM-1 has been proposed to be the main adhesion molecule responsible for monocyte aggregation.

To confirm this, monocytes were incubated with both types of dCGN in the presence of an anti-ICAM-1 antibody, an anti-CD58 antibody and an isotype control IgG1 antibody.

The anti-ICAM-1 antibody effectively blocked the cell aggregates induced by dCGN (Fig. 5D, 5E), strongly suggesting that indeed ICAM-1 is responsible for monocyte aggregation.

Both the control IgG1 and the anti-CD58 antibody did not modify monocyte aggregation (data not shown).
