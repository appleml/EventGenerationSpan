(A) Rnase protection assay for IL4 mRNA from purified B cells (CD19+) from WT and LMP1 transgenic splenocytes.
# T4 Protein S2 31 34 132 135 IL4
# T5 Protein S2 63 67 164 168 CD19
# T6 Protein S2 82 86 183 187 LMP1

The L32 and GAPDH housekeeping genes were used as a loading control.
# T7 Protein S3 4 7 216 219 L32
# T8 Protein S3 12 17 224 229 GAPDH

Arrow indicates the position of the protected probe.

(B and C) Immunoblot analysis of WT and LMP1 transgenic mice for activated pStat6 in (B) purified B cells (CD19+) at the time of harvest or in (C) whole splenocytes cultured with or without IL4.

(B) Actin was used as a loading control, and the white line indicates that intervening lanes have been spliced out.

(D and E) MTS assay of (D) WT lymphocytes and (E) LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells cultured with IL4, a neutralizing antibody to IL4, or a rat IgG isotype control at the indicated concentrations.
# T13 Protein S7 50 54 695 699 LMP1
# T14 Protein S7 95 98 740 743 IL4
# T15 Protein S7 127 130 772 775 IL4

Shown are the results from LMP1 transgenic lymphoma 3.
# T16 Protein S8 27 31 866 870 LMP1

The results are the mean +/- SEM of triplicate samples from a single representative experiment that was repeated twice with similar results.
