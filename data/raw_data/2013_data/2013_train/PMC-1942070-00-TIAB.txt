Protein kinase D enzymes are dispensable for proliferation, survival and antigen receptor-regulated NFkappaB activity in vertebrate B-cells

To investigate the importance of protein kinase D (PKD) enzymes we generated a PKD-null DT40 B-lymphocyte cell line.

Previously we have shown that PKDs have an essential role in regulating class II histone deacetylases in DT40 B-cells [Matthews, S.A., Liu, P., Spitaler, M., Olson, E.N., McKinsey, T.A., Cantrell, D.A. and Scharenberg, A.M. (2006) Essential role for protein kinase D family kinases in the regulation of class II histone deacetylases in B lymphocytes.

We now show that PKDs are also required to regulate HSP27 phosphorylation in DT40 B-cells.

However, in contrast to previous observations in other cell types, PKD enzymes do not regulate basic cellular processes such as proliferation or survival responses, nor NFkappaB transcriptional activity downstream of the B cell antigen receptor.

Thus, PKDs have a selective role in DT40 B-cell biology.
