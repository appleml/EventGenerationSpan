Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is the major oncoprotein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

In transgenic mice, LMP1 promotes increased lymphoma development by 12 mo of age.
# T6 Protein S3 20 24 192 196 LMP1

This study reveals that lymphoma develops in B-1a lymphocytes, a population that is associated with transformation in older mice.

The lymphoma cells have deregulated cell cycle markers, and inhibitors of Akt, NFkappaB, and Stat3 block the enhanced viability of LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells in vitro.

Lymphoma cells are independent of IL4/Stat6 signaling for survival and proliferation, but have constitutively activated Stat3 signaling.

These same targets are also deregulated in wild-type B-1a lymphomas that arise spontaneously through age predisposition.

These results suggest that Akt, NFkappaB, and Stat3 pathways may serve as effective targets in the treatment of EBV-associated B cell lymphomas.
