RNA interference

Jurkat or U937 cells were transfected by electroporation using a Bio-Rad apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).

Briefly, aliquots (5 x 106 cells) were suspended in 0.3 ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and subjected to a double electrical pulse (0.22 V, 960 microF) in the presence of annealed siRNA (200 pmol); electroporated cells were washed and cultured in complete medium.

RNA interference was performed with: siRNA Tat sense, CUGCUUGUACCAAUUGCUAUU and siRNA Tat antisense, UAGCAAUUGGUACAAGCAGUU; siRNA control sense, CUGCUUGUCACA AUUGCUAUU and siRNA control antisense, UAGCAAUUGUGACAAGCAGUU.
# T1 Protein S4 37 52 467 482 siRNA Tat sense
# T2 Protein S4 80 99 510 529 siRNA Tat antisense

RNA interference of p65 and IkappaB-alpha was performed with SMART pool siRNA p65 and IkappaB-alpha (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL, USA).
