Luciferase Reporter Gene Assays

Luciferase reporter gene assays were performed as previously described6.

Briefly, cells were cotransfected at a ratio of 10:1 with various promoter-driven firefly luciferase constructs to the Renilla luciferase pTKRL plasmid, together with indicated plasmids.
# T1 Protein S3 90 100 195 205 luciferase
# T2 Protein S3 127 137 232 242 luciferase

Cells were cultured for 1-2 days and then stimulated in triplicate before harvest.

Lysates were analyzed using the Dual-Luciferase Kit (Promega).
