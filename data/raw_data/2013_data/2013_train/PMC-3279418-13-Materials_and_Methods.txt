BMDC-T cell in vitro interaction

WT and cpdm BMDC (5x104) were stimulated with medium, 1 microg/mL LPS, 25 microg/mL and 5 microg/mL Pam3CYS.

24 hours later, cells were collected and washed with PBS.

Allogeneic naive CD4+ T cells were isolated from spleens of BALB/c mice by negative selection kit (Invitrogen) and were then added at 2.5x105 and co-cultured with activated BMDC.

After 5 days, supernatant was collected and the secretion of IFNgamma, IL4, IL2, and IL17A measured by ELISA.

Negative controls are 1) stimulated BMDC without co-culture with allogeneic CD4+ T cells; 2) allogeneic CD4+ T cells without co-culture with stimulated BMDC.

Both negative controls show no production of aforementioned cytokines.
