GR-GATA-3 In Vitro Competition Assay for Importin-alpha (Far-Western ELISA)
# T1 Protein S1 0 2 0 2 GR
# T2 Protein S1 3 9 3 9 GATA-3

Immunoprecipitated importin-alpha (anti-importin-alpha, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) from HuT-78 cells was separated by SDS-PAGE and purified from the excised gel by electroelution [36].

Similarly, GATA-3 was isolated from nonstimulated HuT-78 cells or cells stimulated for 30 min with anti-CD3/CD28 and GR was isolated from FP (10-8 M, 30 min) stimulated HuT-78 cells.
# T3 Protein S3 11 17 271 277 GATA-3
# T4 Protein S3 117 119 377 379 GR

These proteins were subsequently refolded in glycine solution.

100 microl of importin-alpha solution (100 ng/ml in TBS) was added to 96-well plates coated with goat anti-importin-alpha antibody.

After 1 h incubation, GATA-3 (100 ng/ml in TBS) from stimulated or unstimulated cells were added to the importin-alpha-coated wells.
# T5 Protein S6 22 28 660 666 GATA-3

GR (10 or 100 ng/ml in TBS) from stimulated or unstimulated cells were added to some wells.
# T6 Protein S7 0 2 771 773 GR

After a further 1 h incubation, the plate was washed and incubated with primary antibodies (a mixture of rabbit anti-GATA-3 and mouse anti-GR, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1.5 h, and then incubated with secondary antibodies.

FITC swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako, Cambridge, UK) was used for the detection of GATA-3, and rhodamine donkey anti-mouse IgG (Novus, Littleton, Colorado, USA) was used for the detection of GR.
# T7 Protein S9 79 85 1168 1174 GATA-3
# T8 Protein S9 187 189 1276 1278 GR

FITC and rhodamine levels were measured with a fluorescent micro-plate reader (Bioline, London, UK).
