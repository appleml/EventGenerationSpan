Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)

ChIP assays was performed as previously described6.

The primers used to amplify the promoter region adjacent to the kappaB sites of IL8 and NFKBIA, as well as ACTB have been described6.
# T1 Protein S3 80 83 169 172 IL8
# T2 Protein S3 88 94 177 183 NFKBIA
# T3 Protein S3 107 111 196 200 ACTB
