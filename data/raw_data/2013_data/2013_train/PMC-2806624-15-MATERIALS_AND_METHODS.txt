RNA interference.

CD4+ or naive CD4+ T cells were resuspended in 100 microl of Nucleofector solution (Lonza) and electroporated with 2 microM siRNA using the Nucleofector technology program U-14 (Lonza).
# T1 Protein S2 0 3 18 21 CD4
# T2 Protein S2 14 17 32 35 CD4

Five different Silencer or Silencer Select Pre-designed siRNAs for RUNX1 (Applied Biosystems) and three Silencer Pre-designed siRNAs for RUNX3 (Applied Biosystems) were tested, and the best was selected for all further experiments.

The Silencer Negative Control #1 siRNA (Applied Biosystems) was used for normalization.

Cells were then left unstimulated or were stimulated after 12 h with anti-CD2, anti-CD3, and anti-CD28.
# T5 Protein S5 74 77 598 601 CD2
# T6 Protein S5 84 87 608 611 CD3
# T7 Protein S5 98 102 622 626 CD28

Cells were cultured in serum-free AIM-V medium with the addition of 1 nmol/l IL-2 (Roche).
# T8 Protein S6 34 39 662 667 AIM-V
# T9 Protein S6 77 81 705 709 IL-2

Cells were harvested for mRNA detection of the target genes after 24 h and for protein detection after 48 h.
