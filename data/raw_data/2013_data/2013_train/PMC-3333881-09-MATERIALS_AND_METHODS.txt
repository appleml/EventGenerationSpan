Real-time PCR

Total RNA was extracted from cells by using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen); RNA aliquots (200 ng) were reverse transcribed using Random Examers (Roche) and Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Real-time PCR was performed with the iQ Green Super mix (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and carried out with the iCycler iQ Real-Time detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories) under the following conditions: 95degreesC, 1 min; (94degreesC, 10 s; 60degreesC, 30 s) x40.

Primers for Tat and MIP-1alpha are listed in Supplementary Data.
# T1 Protein S4 12 15 535 538 Tat
# T2 Protein S4 20 30 543 553 MIP-1alpha

Real-time PCR of CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA, TLR2, GAPDH and ACTB was performed using the RT2 profiler PCR Array-Human NF-kappaB signaling pathway (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, USA).

# T7 Protein S5 42 47 630 635 GAPDH
# T8 Protein S5 52 56 640 644 ACTB

Reactions were carried out in triplicate, and gene expression levels were calculated relative to GAPDH mRNA levels as endogenous control.
