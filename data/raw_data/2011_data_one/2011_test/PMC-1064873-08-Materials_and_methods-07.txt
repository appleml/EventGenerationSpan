Western blot analysis

CD4+ T cells were stimulated for 20 min by the indicated concentrations of IL-10 and IL-6 at a density of 5 x 105 cells in 0.5 ml culture medium with 10% FCS.

# T2 Protein S2 75 80 97 102 IL-10
# T3 Protein S2 85 89 107 111 IL-6

To examine the effect of serum IL-6 on STAT phosphorylation, normal CD4+ T cells were stimulated for 20 min with 30% active RA serum in culture medium with 40 mug/ml neutralizing goat anti-IL-6 polyclonal antibody (IgG; Techne, Princeton, NJ, USA) or control goat IgG (Techne).

# T5 Protein S3 68 71 249 252 CD4
# T6 Protein S3 189 193 370 374 IL-6

Whole cell lysates were prepared by placing cells in 100 mul SDS lysing buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% bromphenol blue).

Then 20 mul protein samples were fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK), and the membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 was detected using commercial available kits (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

# T8 Protein S6 38 43 922 927 STAT3

Briefly, the membrane was incubated with the antibodies (rabbit IgG) anti-STAT1 antibody, anti-phosphorylated tyrosine 701 of STAT1 antibody, anti-STAT3 antibody, and anti-phosphorylated tyrosine 705 of STAT3 antibody, diluted as recommended at 1/2000 with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 with 5% BSA.

# T10 Protein S7 126 131 1191 1196 STAT1
# T11 Protein S7 147 152 1212 1217 STAT3
# T12 Protein S7 203 208 1268 1273 STAT3

Antibody binding was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody diluted at 1/4000 with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 with 5% BSA, and was revealed using the chemiluminescence system.

Protein bands were quantified by densitometry using NIH-Image analysis, and STAT phosphorylation was compared with the total amount of STAT protein.

IFN-gamma-stimulated Hela cells were used as a positive control for STAT1 phosophorylation.
