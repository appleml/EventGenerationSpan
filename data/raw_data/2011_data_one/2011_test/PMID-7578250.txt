Cloning a cDNA from human NK/T cells which codes for a protein with high proline content.

A cDNA clone, B4-2, was isolated from a natural killer (NK) minus T cell subtractive library.
# T1 Protein S2 14 18 105 109 B4-2

The B4-2 clone coded for an mRNA of 2061 bp in length.
# T2 Protein S3 4 8 189 193 B4-2

It encodes a deduced 327 aa protein with a calculated molecular mass of 35.2 kDa.

Searching of B4-2 DNA and protein sequences against various databases revealed no high homology to other sequences.
# T3 Protein S5 13 17 335 339 B4-2

However, B4-2 has an unusually high proline content (13%), contains a putative nuclear targeting sequence, and has several SPXX motifs which are frequently found in gene regulatory proteins.
# T4 Protein S6 9 13 447 451 B4-2

One of the stretches of prolines in B4-2 closely resembles the ligand for proteins with SH3 domains.
# T5 Protein S7 36 40 665 669 B4-2

Northern hybridization data showed that B4-2 is not a lymphoid specific gene and is expressed in a hepatoma cell line and also weakly transcribed or absent in a variety of other cells.
# T6 Protein S8 40 44 770 774 B4-2

A polyclonal antiserum raised against recombinant B4-2 recognizes a 32-34 kDa protein in lymphocytes.
# T7 Protein S9 50 54 965 969 B4-2
