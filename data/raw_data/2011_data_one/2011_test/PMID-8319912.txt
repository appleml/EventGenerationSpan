The p65 subunit of NF-kappa B regulates I kappa B by two distinct mechanisms.
# T1 Protein S1 4 7 4 7 p65

Transcription factor NF-kappa B (p50/p65) is generally localized to the cytoplasm by its inhibitor I kappa B. Overproduced I kappa B, free from NF-kappa B, is rapidly degraded.
# T2 Protein S2 33 36 112 115 p50
# T3 Protein S2 37 40 116 119 p65

Overexpression of p65 increases endogenous I kappa B protein in both carcinoma and lymphoid cells by two mechanisms: protein stabilization and increased transcription of I kappa B mRNA.
# T4 Protein S3 18 21 274 277 p65

In contrast, p65 delta, a naturally occurring splice variant, fails to markedly augment I kappa B protein levels.
# T5 Protein S4 13 22 455 464 p65 delta

Both overexpressed p65 and coexpressed p50 are cytoplasmic, whereas p65 delta is partly nuclear, indicating that the I kappa B induced by p65 can maintain NF-kappa B in the cytoplasm.
# T6 Protein S5 19 22 575 578 p65
# T7 Protein S5 39 42 595 598 p50
# T8 Protein S5 68 77 624 633 p65 delta
# T9 Protein S5 138 141 694 697 p65

Thus, p65 and I kappa B are linked in an autoregulatory loop, ensuring that NF-kappa B is held in the cytoplasm until cells are specifically induced to translocate it to the nucleus.
