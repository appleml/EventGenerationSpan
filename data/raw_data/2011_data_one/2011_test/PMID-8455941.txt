The transcriptionally active factors mediating the effect of the HTLV-I Tax transactivator on the IL-2R alpha kappa B enhancer include the product of the c-rel proto-oncogene.
# T1 Protein S1 72 75 72 75 Tax
# T2 Protein S1 98 109 98 109 IL-2R alpha
# T3 Protein S1 154 159 154 159 c-rel

The transactivator HTLV-I Tax activates the promoter of the gene coding for the interleukin 2 alpha-chain receptor (IL-2R alpha) via a kappa B site that can bind several protein species of the rel family.
# T4 Protein S2 26 29 203 206 Tax
# T5 Protein S2 80 114 257 291 interleukin 2 alpha-chain receptor
# T6 Protein S2 116 127 293 304 IL-2R alpha

Tax1 strongly activates the enhancer activity of this motif, in both epithelial HeLa and lymphoid Jurkat cells.
# T7 Protein S3 0 4 382 386 Tax1

This activation was not observed in undifferentiated embryocarcinoma F9 cells.

Overexpression of the p50, p65 and Rel proteins in these cells showed that significant activation of the IL-2R alpha kappa B site was observed only with Rel and Rel plus p65.
# T8 Protein S5 22 25 595 598 p50
# T9 Protein S5 27 30 600 603 p65
# T10 Protein S5 105 116 678 689 IL-2R alpha
# T11 Protein S5 170 173 743 746 p65

Moreover, whereas both Tax and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) are able to efficiently induce the binding of NF-kappa B to the IL-2R alpha kappa B site, PMA is functionally inactive.
# T12 Protein S6 23 26 771 774 Tax
# T13 Protein S6 133 144 881 892 IL-2R alpha

Using the DNA affinity precipitation assay, we observed that Tax1 is able to efficiently induce the binding of Rel, whereas PMA is not.
# T14 Protein S7 61 65 998 1002 Tax1

This established a clear difference between both stimuli, indicating that Rel is the functionally active factor.

We conclude from these results that the functional activity of members of the rel family is regulated by their interaction with DNA and that Rel can be a potent transcriptional activator on specific kappa B sites.
