Expression and role of PML gene in normal adult hematopoiesis: functional interaction between PML and Rb proteins in erythropoiesis.
# T1 Protein S1 23 26 23 26 PML
# T2 Protein S1 94 97 94 97 PML
# T3 Protein S1 102 104 102 104 Rb

The expression of the PML gene was investigated in purified early hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) induced to unilineage erythroid or granulocytic differentiation.
# T4 Protein S2 22 25 156 159 PML

PML mRNA and protein, while barely detectable in quiescent HPCs, are consistently induced by growth factor stimulation through the erythroid or granulocytic lineage.
# T5 Protein S3 0 3 303 306 PML

Thereafter, PML is downmodulated in late granulocytic maturation, whereas it is sustainably expressed through the erythroid pathway.
# T6 Protein S4 12 15 481 484 PML

In functional studies, PML expression was inhibited by addition of antisense oligomers targeting PML mRNA (alpha-PML).
# T7 Protein S5 23 26 625 628 PML
# T8 Protein S5 97 100 699 702 PML

Interestingly, early treatment (day 0 HPCs) with alpha-PML reduced the number of both erythroid and granulocytic colonies, whereas late treatment (day 5 culture) reduced erythroid, but not granulocytic, clonogenesis.

These findings suggest that PML is required for early hematopoiesis and erythroid, but not granulocytic maturation.
# T9 Protein S7 28 31 966 969 PML

The pattern of PML expression in normal hematopoiesis mimics that of retinoblastoma pRb 105.
# T10 Protein S8 15 18 1069 1072 PML
# T11 Protein S8 84 91 1138 1145 pRb 105

Combined treatment of HPCs with alpha-PML and alpha-Rb oligomers inhibited both PML and Rb protein expression and completely blocked erythroid colony development.
# T12 Protein S9 80 83 1227 1230 PML
# T13 Protein S9 88 90 1235 1237 Rb

Furthermore, PML and pRb 105 were co-immunoprecipitated in cellular lysates derived from erythroid precursors indicating that this functional interaction may have a biochemical basis.
# T14 Protein S10 13 16 1323 1326 PML
# T15 Protein S10 21 28 1331 1338 pRb 105

These results suggest a key functional role of PML in early hematopoiesis and late erythropoiesis: the latter phenomenon may be related to the molecular and functional interaction of PML with pRb 105.

# T17 Protein S11 183 186 1677 1680 PML
# T18 Protein S11 192 199 1686 1693 pRb 105
