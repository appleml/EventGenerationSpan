[Induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes by glucocorticoids: between physiology and pharmacology]

Glucocorticoids are physiological molecules that are also extensively used in clinics as anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive or anti-tumoral agents.

Glucocorticoids can induce apoptosis on normal lymphoid cells and play a key role in the physiology of thymic selection.

In clinics these molecules are also used for their potencies in inducing apoptosis of malignant lymphoid cells.

Glucocorticoids are mediating their effects after binding to an intracellular receptor belonging to the steroid receptor superfamily: the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).
# T1 Protein S5 138 161 618 641 glucocorticoid receptor
# T2 Protein S5 163 165 643 645 GR

Once activated, the GR, can mediate his effects through direct binding on the DNA or via protein/protein interactions with transcription factors.
# T3 Protein S6 20 22 668 670 GR

Depending on the type of lymphocytes, the mechanism of apoptosis induced by glucocorticoids fall roughly in two categories: induction of "death genes" by the activated GR (I kappa B, c-jun) or repression of survival factors (AP-1, c-Myc).
# T4 Protein S7 168 170 962 964 GR
# T5 Protein S7 183 188 977 982 c-jun
# T6 Protein S7 231 236 1025 1030 c-Myc

In the case of thymic selection the mechanism is more subtle depending on the mutual repression of Nur77 and GR.
# T7 Protein S8 99 104 1132 1137 Nur77
# T8 Protein S8 109 111 1142 1144 GR
