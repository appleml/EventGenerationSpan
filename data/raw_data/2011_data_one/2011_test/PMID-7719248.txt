A newly established megakaryoblastic/erythroid cell line that differentiates to red cells in the presence of erythropoietin and produces platelet-like particles.

In August, 1992, we established a leukemic cell line (NS-Meg) from a patient in megakaryoblastic transformation of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia.

The NS-Meg cells were positive for alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining and for surface CD4, CD7, CD13, CD34, CD41a, and glycophorin A antigens.
# T2 Protein S3 123 126 460 463 CD4
# T3 Protein S3 128 131 465 468 CD7
# T4 Protein S3 133 137 470 474 CD13
# T5 Protein S3 139 143 476 480 CD34
# T6 Protein S3 145 150 482 487 CD41a
# T7 Protein S3 156 169 493 506 glycophorin A

Ultrastructurally, the cells had alpha-granules, demarcation membranes, and platelet peroxidase activity.

The NS-Meg cells spontaneously produced platelet-like particles which contained alpha-granules, mitochondria and dense bodies, strongly suggesting platelet production.

Erythropoietin (Epo), granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor(GM-CSF), and interleukin 3 (IL-3) promoted the growth of NS-Meg cells.
# T8 Protein S6 0 14 791 805 Erythropoietin
# T9 Protein S6 16 19 807 810 Epo
# T10 Protein S6 22 70 813 861 granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor
# T11 Protein S6 71 77 862 868 GM-CSF
# T12 Protein S6 84 97 875 888 interleukin 3
# T13 Protein S6 99 103 890 894 IL-3

Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate increased the expression of both CD41a and CD61 antigens.
# T14 Protein S7 65 70 998 1003 CD41a
# T15 Protein S7 75 79 1008 1012 CD61

Ten-day exposure to Epo induced mature erythroblasts and red cells.
# T16 Protein S8 20 23 1043 1046 Epo

These benzidine-positive cells were positive for hemoglobin F staining.

Untreated NS-Meg cells expressed mRNA for the Epo receptor (EpoR), for GATA-1, and for alpha 1, alpha 2 and gamma globin genes.
# T17 Protein S10 46 58 1209 1221 Epo receptor
# T18 Protein S10 60 64 1223 1227 EpoR
# T19 Protein S10 71 77 1234 1240 GATA-1

These results indicate that NS-Meg cells undergo terminal differentiation of both megakaryocytic and erythroid lineages.

This cell line should be a very useful tool for the investigation of both megakaryocytic and erythroid maturation.
