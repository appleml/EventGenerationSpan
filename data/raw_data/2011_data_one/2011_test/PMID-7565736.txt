PU.1 (Spi-1) and C/EBP alpha regulate expression of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor alpha gene.
# T1 Protein S1 0 4 0 4 PU.1
# T2 Protein S1 6 11 6 11 Spi-1
# T3 Protein S1 17 28 17 28 C/EBP alpha
# T4 Protein S1 56 119 56 119 granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor alpha

Growth factor receptors play an important role in hematopoiesis.

In order to further understand the mechanisms directing the expression of these key regulators of hematopoiesis, we initiated a study investigating the transcription factors activating the expression of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor alpha gene.
# T5 Protein S3 207 279 399 471 granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor alpha

Here, we demonstrate that the human GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter directs reporter gene activity in a tissue-specific fashion in myelomonocytic cells, which correlates with its expression pattern as analyzed by reverse transcription PCR.
# T6 Protein S4 36 57 514 535 GM-CSF receptor alpha

The GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter contains an important functional site between positions -53 and -41 as identified by deletion analysis of reporter constructs.
# T7 Protein S5 4 25 721 742 GM-CSF receptor alpha

We show that the myeloid and B cell transcription factor PU.1 binds specifically to this site.
# T8 Protein S6 57 61 936 940 PU.1

Furthermore, we demonstrate that a CCAAT site located upstream of the PU.1 site between positions -70 and -54 is involved in positive-negative regulation of the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter activity.
# T9 Protein S7 70 74 1044 1048 PU.1
# T10 Protein S7 161 182 1135 1156 GM-CSF receptor alpha

C/EBP alpha is the major CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) form binding to this site in nuclear extracts of U937 cells.
# T11 Protein S8 0 11 1176 1187 C/EBP alpha

Point mutations of either the PU.1 site or the C/EBP site that abolish the binding of the respective factors result in a significant decrease of GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter activity in myelomonocytic cells only.
# T12 Protein S9 30 34 1331 1335 PU.1
# T13 Protein S9 145 166 1446 1467 GM-CSF receptor alpha

Furthermore, we demonstrate that in myeloid and B cell extracts, PU.1 forms a novel, specific, more slowly migrating complex (PU-SF) when binding the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter PU.1 site.
# T14 Protein S10 65 69 1581 1585 PU.1
# T15 Protein S10 150 171 1666 1687 GM-CSF receptor alpha
# T16 Protein S10 181 185 1697 1701 PU.1

This is the first demonstration of a specific interaction with PU.1 on a myeloid PU.1 binding site.
# T17 Protein S11 63 67 1771 1775 PU.1
# T18 Protein S11 81 85 1789 1793 PU.1

The novel complex is distinct from that described previously as binding to B cell enhancer sites and can be formed by addition of PU.1 to extracts from certain nonmyeloid cell types which do not express PU.1, including T cells and epithelial cells, but not from erythroid cells.
# T19 Protein S12 130 134 1938 1942 PU.1
# T20 Protein S12 203 207 2011 2015 PU.1

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the PU-SF complex binds to PU.1 sites found on a number of myeloid promoters, and its formation requires an intact PU.1 site adjacent to a single-stranded region.
# T21 Protein S13 60 64 2147 2151 PU.1
# T22 Protein S13 148 152 2235 2239 PU.1

Expression of PU.1 in nonmyeloid cells can activate the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter.
# T23 Protein S14 14 18 2297 2301 PU.1
# T24 Protein S14 56 77 2339 2360 GM-CSF receptor alpha

Deletion of the amino-terminal region of PU.1 results in a failure to form the PU-SF complex and in a concomitant loss of transactivation, suggesting that formation of the PU-SF complex is of functional importance for the activity of the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter.
# T25 Protein S15 41 45 2412 2416 PU.1
# T26 Protein S15 238 259 2609 2630 GM-CSF receptor alpha

Finally, we demonstrate that C/EBP alpha can also active the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter in nonmyeloid cells.
# T27 Protein S16 29 40 2670 2681 C/EBP alpha
# T28 Protein S16 61 82 2702 2723 GM-CSF receptor alpha
