Aiolos transcription factor controls cell death in T cells by regulating Bcl-2 expression and its cellular localization.
# T1 Protein S1 0 6 0 6 Aiolos
# T2 Protein S1 73 78 73 78 Bcl-2

We searched for proteins that interact with Ras in interleukin (IL)-2-stimulated or IL-2-deprived cells, and found that the transcription factor Aiolos interacts with Ras.
# T3 Protein S2 51 69 173 191 interleukin (IL)-2
# T4 Protein S2 84 88 206 210 IL-2
# T5 Protein S2 145 151 267 273 Aiolos

The Ras-Aiolos interaction was confirmed in vitro and in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation.
# T6 Protein S3 8 14 302 308 Aiolos

Indirect immunofluorescence shows that IL-2 controls the cellular distribution of Aiolos and induces its tyrosine phosphorylation, required for dissociation from Ras.
# T7 Protein S4 39 43 422 426 IL-2
# T8 Protein S4 82 88 465 471 Aiolos

We also identified functional Aiolos-binding sites in the Bcl-2 promoter, which are able to activate the luciferase reporter gene.
# T9 Protein S5 30 36 580 586 Aiolos
# T10 Protein S5 58 63 608 613 Bcl-2
# T11 Protein S5 105 115 655 665 luciferase

Mutation of Aiolos-binding sites within the Bcl-2 promoter inhibits transactivation of the reporter gene luciferase, suggesting direct control of Bcl-2 expression by Aiolos.
# T12 Protein S6 12 18 693 699 Aiolos
# T13 Protein S6 44 49 725 730 Bcl-2
# T14 Protein S6 105 115 786 796 luciferase
# T15 Protein S6 146 151 827 832 Bcl-2
# T16 Protein S6 166 172 847 853 Aiolos

Co-transfection experiments confirm that Aiolos induces Bcl-2 expression and prevents apoptosis in IL-2-deprived cells.
# T17 Protein S7 41 47 896 902 Aiolos
# T18 Protein S7 56 61 911 916 Bcl-2
# T19 Protein S7 99 103 954 958 IL-2

We propose a model for the regulation of Bcl-2 expression via Aiolos.
# T20 Protein S8 41 46 1016 1021 Bcl-2
# T21 Protein S8 62 68 1037 1043 Aiolos
