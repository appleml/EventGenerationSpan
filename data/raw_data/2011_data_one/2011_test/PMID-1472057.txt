Mutations in the Pit-1 gene in children with combined pituitary hormone deficiency.
# T1 Protein S1 17 22 17 22 Pit-1

Pit-1 is a pituitary-specific transcription factor that binds to and transactivates promoters of growth hormone and prolactin genes.
# T2 Protein S2 0 5 85 90 Pit-1

In three unrelated Japanese children with combined pituitary hormone deficiency, we identified three point mutations in the Pit-1 gene, Pro24Leu, Arg143Gln, and Arg271Trp, located on the major transactivation region, POU-specific domain, and POU-homeodomain, respectively.
