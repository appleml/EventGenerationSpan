Expression of the nucleoside diphosphate kinase in human skin cancers: an immunohistochemical study.
# T1 Protein S1 18 47 18 47 nucleoside diphosphate kinase

Expression of nucleoside diphosphate(NDP) kinase, which is homologous to the nm23 gene product in a variety of species, has been found to be inversely associated with metastatic potential.
# T2 Protein S2 14 48 116 150 nucleoside diphosphate(NDP) kinase
# T3 Protein S2 77 81 179 183 nm23

However, the relationship remains controversial according to the tumor cell types and experimental system, with conflicting results from different research groups.

In order to determine whether NDP kinase expression serves as a marker for metastatic potential in human skin cancer, we assessed the levels of NDP kinase expression in 9 keratoacanthomas (KAs), 26 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), and 25 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) using immunohistochemistry.
# T4 Protein S4 30 40 485 495 NDP kinase
# T5 Protein S4 144 154 599 609 NDP kinase

The expression of NDP kinase was intense in KA and SCC compared with BCC.
# T6 Protein S5 18 28 768 778 NDP kinase

However, the difference of NDP kinase expression between KA and SCC was not statistically significant.
# T7 Protein S6 27 37 851 861 NDP kinase

And there was no statistically significant difference in NDP kinase expression between SCC with metastasis and SCC without metastasis.
# T8 Protein S7 57 67 984 994 NDP kinase

Our results contradict the hypothesis concerning the possible role of nm23 gene as a metastatic suppressor gene in human skin cancer.
# T9 Protein S8 70 74 1132 1136 nm23

The mechanism of overexpression in various tumor cell types and its biological significance in cutaneous carcinogenesis remain to be determined.
