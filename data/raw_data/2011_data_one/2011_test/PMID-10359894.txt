Effects of diesel organic extracts on chemokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

BACKGROUND: Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) associated with diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) are found in the atmospheric urban pollution.

Such compounds have been shown to favor IgE production, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation.

Chemokines are a group of chemotactic cytokines involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of DEP-PAHs on the release and mRNA expression of IL-8, MCP-1, and RANTES by PBMCs obtained from healthy subjects.
# T1 Protein S5 88 92 537 541 IL-8
# T2 Protein S5 94 99 543 548 MCP-1
# T3 Protein S5 105 111 554 560 RANTES

METHODS: Protein production in supernatants was assessed by ELISA, and mRNA expression was evaluated by semiquantitative RT-PCR.

RESULTS: Secretion of IL-8 and RANTES increased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing concentrations of DEP-PAHs (range, 0.5 ng to 50 ng/mL).
# T4 Protein S7 22 26 753 757 IL-8
# T5 Protein S7 31 37 762 768 RANTES

On the contrary, the release of MCP-1 was significantly inhibited, also in a dose-dependent manner.
# T6 Protein S8 32 37 910 915 MCP-1

Messenger RNA production coding for IL-8, RANTES, and MCP-1 showed parallel variations to the production of the correspondent proteins.
# T7 Protein S9 36 40 1014 1018 IL-8
# T8 Protein S9 42 48 1020 1026 RANTES
# T9 Protein S9 54 59 1032 1037 MCP-1

Effects of DEP-PAHs became significant at 7 hours and up to 48 hours time culture for MCP-1, and up to 24 hours time culture for IL-8 and RANTES.
# T10 Protein S10 86 91 1200 1205 MCP-1
# T11 Protein S10 129 133 1243 1247 IL-8
# T12 Protein S10 138 144 1252 1258 RANTES

Moreover, supernatants from DEP-PAH-activated cells, compared with those of controls, exhibited a significantly enhanced chemotactic activity for neutrophils and eosinophils, which was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with anti-IL-8 and anti-RANTES neutralizing antibodies, respectively.
# T13 Protein S11 235 239 1495 1499 IL-8
# T14 Protein S11 249 255 1509 1515 RANTES

CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the chemokine pathways are modulated by DEP-PAHs at the transcriptional level, reinforcing the idea that the development of inflammatory reactions might be affected by diesel exhaust emission.
