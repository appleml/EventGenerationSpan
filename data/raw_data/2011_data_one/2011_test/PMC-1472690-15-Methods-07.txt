Cytokine measurements

Supernatants of cell cultures were harvested 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 and 48 hours after stimulation and stored at -80 degreesC until used and thawed only once.

IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-1 and IL-6 were determined using an ELISA from Bender Systems (Vienna, Austria), IL-1RA and IL-8 by an ELISA from R&D Systems (Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany), and TGFbeta 1 using an ELISA as previously described [57].
# T1 Protein S3 0 8 186 194 IFNgamma
# T2 Protein S3 10 18 196 204 TNFalpha
# T3 Protein S3 20 24 206 210 IL-1
# T4 Protein S3 29 33 215 219 IL-6
# T5 Protein S3 104 110 290 296 IL-1RA
# T6 Protein S3 115 119 301 305 IL-8
# T7 Protein S3 187 196 373 382 TGFbeta 1

Quantification of IL-2 as an indicator for the bioactivity of IL-1 was done as previously described [46].
# T8 Protein S4 18 22 446 450 IL-2
# T9 Protein S4 62 66 490 494 IL-1

Samples were diluted in the same buffer as that used for the standards.

All cytokines were quantified using an ELISA plate reader (Anthos Labotec, Salzburg, Austria or Microplate Reader, BioRad).

Cytokine amounts were all within the range of the standard curve.

Only stimulation of PBMC observed in donors showing no spontaneous cytokine release was included in the statistics.
