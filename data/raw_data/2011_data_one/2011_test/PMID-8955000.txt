HIV-1 LTR activity in human CD40-activated B lymphocytes is dependent on NF-kappaB.
# T1 Protein S1 28 32 28 32 CD40

CD40-stimulated human B lymphocytes are highly permissive to a productive infection by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1.
# T2 Protein S2 0 4 85 89 CD40

In these cells, nuclear factors involved in activation of the HIV-1 LTR, which contains the transcriptional control elements of the virus, are unknown.

Transient expression assays with plasmids containing deleted parts of the LTR region linked to a reporter gene showed that the NF-kappaB binding site was essential for HIV-1 LTR activity in CD40-stimulated B lymphocytes.
# T3 Protein S4 190 194 555 559 CD40

In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays revealed that important NF-kappaB binding activity composed of at least p50, p65, and c-Rel NF-kappaB subunits was present in nuclei of CD40-stimulated B cells.
# T4 Protein S5 138 141 724 727 p50
# T5 Protein S5 143 146 729 732 p65
# T6 Protein S5 152 157 738 743 c-Rel
# T7 Protein S5 202 206 788 792 CD40

These results confirm at a molecular level the ability of HIV-1 to replicate in B cells and that this activity is strongly associated with NF-kappaB.
