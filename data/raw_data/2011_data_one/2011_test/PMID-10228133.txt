Increased glucocorticoid receptor beta in airway cells of glucocorticoid-insensitive asthma.
# T1 Protein S1 10 38 10 38 glucocorticoid receptor beta

Glucocorticoid (GC)-insensitive asthma is a challenging clinical problem that can be associated with life-threatening disease progression.

The molecular basis of GC insensitivity is unknown.

Alternative splicing of the GC receptor (GCR) pre-mRNA generates a second GCR, termed GCRbeta, which does not bind GC but antagonizes the transactivating activity of the classic GCR.
# T2 Protein S4 28 39 313 324 GC receptor
# T3 Protein S4 41 44 326 329 GCR
# T4 Protein S4 86 93 371 378 GCRbeta
# T5 Protein S4 178 181 463 466 GCR

Thus increased expression of GCRbeta could account for glucocorticoid insensitivity.
# T6 Protein S5 29 36 497 504 GCRbeta

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were examined for GCRbeta immunoreactivity using a GCRbeta-specific antibody by immunohistochemical staining.
# T7 Protein S6 99 106 652 659 GCRbeta
# T8 Protein S6 132 139 685 692 GCRbeta

Cell localization of GCRbeta expression was performed using a double immunostaining technique.
# T9 Protein S7 21 28 765 772 GCRbeta

Patients with GC-insensitive asthma expressed a significantly higher number of GCRbeta-immunoreactive cells in their BAL and peripheral blood than GC-sensitive asthmatics or normal control subjects.
# T10 Protein S8 79 86 918 925 GCRbeta

Furthermore, GCRbeta expression in GC-insensitive asthma was particularly high in airway T cells, which are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of asthma.
# T11 Protein S9 13 20 1051 1058 GCRbeta

We also examined the expression of GCRbeta in specimens from the airways of patients with chronic bronchitis.
# T12 Protein S10 35 42 1241 1248 GCRbeta

In chronic bronchitis, few cells were GCRbeta-positive and their numbers did not differ significantly from normal control subjects.
# T13 Protein S11 38 45 1354 1361 GCRbeta

We conclude that GC-insensitive asthma is associated with increased expression of GCRbeta in airway T cells.
