GP modulated LPS- and TSST-1-induced binding to a new NFkappaB3 site in the IL-1RA promoter.
# T1 Protein S1 22 28 22 28 TSST-1
# T2 Protein S1 76 82 76 82 IL-1RA

Binding was enhanced for GP + LPS and GP + TSST-1, when compared to LPS, TSST-1, GP, GP/LPS calc.
# T3 Protein S2 43 49 136 142 TSST-1
# T4 Protein S2 73 79 166 172 TSST-1

or GP/TSST-1 calc., respectively (* = p < 0.05; ** = p < 0.01).
# T5 Protein S3 6 12 197 203 TSST-1

Medium control levels were set equal to 1 +/- SEM (n = 6).

DNA binding was assessed by EMSA (see methods).
