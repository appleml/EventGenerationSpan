Growth regulation and cellular changes during differentiation of human prostatic cancer LNCaP cells as induced by T lymphocyte-conditioned medium.

Human prostatic epithelial cells from an androgen-dependent LNCaP cell line were examined in response to conditioned medium (CM) derived from phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes.
# T1 Protein S2 142 160 290 308 phytohemagglutinin
# T2 Protein S2 162 165 310 313 PHA

Addition of CM caused a greater than 70% reduction of cell proliferation by cell counting and cell cycle.

These cells showed G1 phase arrest and the clonogenicity was reduced.

The growth-modulating effect was dose-dependent and not due to cell lysis or apoptosis.

The binding of androgen to androgen receptor on these cells showed approximately 50% reduction, underlining a proliferation reduction mechanism.

The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was downregulated to approximately 75% during the process.
# T3 Protein S7 4 29 752 777 prostate-specific antigen
# T4 Protein S7 31 34 779 782 PSA

Cell morphology showed dendritic processes extending from cytoplasm and other neuroendocrine cell characteristics.

The expression of several cytoskeleton and intracellular proteins increased as determined by immunostaining on slides and by ELISA procedures.

These included vimentin, correlating to cell shape changes, cytokeratins 8 and 18, associated with differentiated cell types of prostate epithelia, and neuron-specific enolase and serotonin, associated with neuroendocrine cells.
# T5 Protein S10 15 23 1116 1124 vimentin
# T6 Protein S10 152 175 1253 1276 neuron-specific enolase

From these cellular changes, we can infer that the cell growth was modulated along with induction of terminal differentiation.

Activated T cells were demonstrated to be important in providing the modulating activity.

This growth modulator was semipurified and had an estimated molecular weight 13,000 to 24,000 Da.

The activity was determined to be distinct from TGF, TNF, and some commonly known lymphokines.

The interaction between lymphoid and prostatic cells in growth and development is described.
