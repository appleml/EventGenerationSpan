Tyrphostin AG-490 inhibits cytokine-mediated JAK3/STAT5a/b signal transduction and cellular proliferation of antigen-activated human T cells.

Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase required for T cell development and activated by cytokines that utilize the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor common gamma chain (gamma(c)).
# T4 Protein S2 0 14 143 157 Janus kinase 3
# T5 Protein S2 16 20 159 163 JAK3
# T6 Protein S2 131 179 274 322 interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor common gamma chain
# T7 Protein S2 181 189 324 332 gamma(c)

Genetic inactivation of JAK3 is manifested as severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) in humans and mice.
# T8 Protein S3 24 28 359 363 JAK3

These findings have suggested that JAK3 represents a pharmacological target to control certain lymphoid-derived diseases.
# T9 Protein S4 35 39 484 488 JAK3

Here we provide novel evidence that AG-490 potently inhibits the autokinase activity of JAK3 and tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5a and 5b (STAT5a/b).
# T10 Protein S5 88 92 659 663 JAK3
# T11 Protein S5 141 192 712 763 signal transducer and activator of transcription 5a
# T12 Protein S5 197 199 768 770 5b
# T13 Protein S5 201 207 772 778 STAT5a
# T14 Protein S5 208 209 779 780 b

Similar inhibitory effects were observed with other cytokines that use gamma(c).
# T15 Protein S6 71 79 854 862 gamma(c)

AG-490 also inhibited IL-2-mediated proliferative growth in human T cells with an IC50) = 25 microM that was partially recoverable.
# T16 Protein S7 22 26 886 890 IL-2

Moreover, we demonstrate that this inhibitor prevented tetanus toxoid antigen-specific T cell proliferation and expansion but failed to block activation of Zap70 or p56Lck after anti-CD3 stimulation of human T cells.
# T17 Protein S8 156 161 1152 1157 Zap70
# T18 Protein S8 165 171 1161 1167 p56Lck

Taken together, these findings suggest that AG-490 inhibits the JAK3-mediated Type II signaling pathway but not the T cell receptor-derived Type I pathway and possesses therapeutic potential for T cell-derived pathologies such as graft-versus-host disease, allergy, and autoimmune disorders.
