Glucocorticoid receptors are down-regulated in inflamed colonic mucosa but not in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with inflammatory bowel disease [see comments]
# T1 Protein S1 0 24 0 24 Glucocorticoid receptors

BACKGROUND: Growing evidence indicates that the immune system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system are linked by several mechanisms, for example intracellular glucocorticoid receptors (hGR).
# T2 Protein S2 168 192 347 371 glucocorticoid receptors
# T3 Protein S2 194 197 373 376 hGR

Glucocorticoids are the standard treatment of acute attacks of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Binding of glucocorticoids to hGR down-regulates the transcription of inflammatory genes that can propagate IBD.
# T4 Protein S4 30 33 506 509 hGR

PATIENTS AND METHODS: IBD patients were either treated with 5-60 mg of prednisolone for more than 1 week or were without glucocorticoid treatment for more than 4 weeks.

hGR levels were determined from isolated cytosol of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or mucosal biopsies using a radioassay with [3H]-dexamethasone.
# T5 Protein S6 0 3 758 761 hGR

Interleukin (IL) 6 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
# T6 Protein S7 0 18 917 935 Interleukin (IL) 6

RESULTS: The systemic (PBMC) hGR levels of corticosteroid-treated IBD patients were significantly lower than those of control subjects (59.6 +/- 57.1 dpm mg-1 cytosol protein vs. 227.0 +/- 90.8 dpm mg-1 cytosol protein, P = 0.007) and IBD patients not receiving glucocorticoid treatment (179.7 +/- 171.3 dpm mg-1 cytosol protein, P = 0.002).
# T7 Protein S8 29 32 1034 1037 hGR

Systemic hGR levels in untreated IBD patients did not differ significantly from those in control subjects.
# T8 Protein S9 9 12 1356 1359 hGR

In patients with connective tissue diseases, systemic hGR levels were also found to be decreased in the absence of glucocorticoid treatment.
# T9 Protein S10 54 57 1508 1511 hGR

Systemic hGR levels in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) treated with steroids (66.6 +/- 61.0 dpm mg-1 cytosol protein) were not different from those in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (56.1 +/- 51.6 dpm mg-1 cytosol protein).
# T10 Protein S11 9 12 1604 1607 hGR

In contrast to these findings, mucosal hGR levels were significantly decreased in both steroid-treated (18.0 +/- 15.5) and not steroid-treated (37.8 +/- 30.5) patients compared with control subjects ( 125.6 +/- 97.1; P = 0.00009 and P = 0.0008 respectively ).
# T11 Protein S12 39 42 1868 1871 hGR

IL-6 levels in all IBD groups with and without steroids were significantly different from those in control subjects.
# T12 Protein S13 0 4 2089 2093 IL-6

CONCLUSION: In IBD there is no difference in systemic hGR levels between not steroid-treated patients and control subjects, in spite of inflammatory activity (IL-6).
# T13 Protein S14 54 57 2260 2263 hGR
# T14 Protein S14 159 163 2365 2369 IL-6

Mucosal hGR levels were decreased independently of treatment, probably leading to a decreased protection against NF-kappaB action in the intestinal mucosa.
# T15 Protein S15 8 11 2380 2383 hGR
