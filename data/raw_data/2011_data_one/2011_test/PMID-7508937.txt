rel Is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated following granulocyte-colony stimulating factor treatment of human neutrophils.

Stimulation of neutrophils with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) results in an enhanced respiratory burst, prolonged survival, and increased tumor cell killing.
# T3 Protein S2 32 69 152 189 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor
# T4 Protein S2 71 76 191 196 G-CSF

The effects of G-CSF are mediated by binding to specific, high affinity receptors.
# T5 Protein S3 15 20 309 314 G-CSF

G-CSF receptors lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, but activation of the receptor results in the rapid induction of tyrosine kinase activity.
# T6 Protein S4 0 5 377 382 G-CSF

Antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots of whole cell lysates prepared from neutrophils show that the G-CSF rapidly induces prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein of a relative molecular mass of 80 kDa.
# T7 Protein S5 94 99 619 624 G-CSF

Using monospecific antibodies, the 80-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein has been shown to be p80c-rel, a proto-oncogene belonging to a family of transcriptional regulators which include NF-kB.
# T8 Protein S6 95 103 824 832 p80c-rel

The induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of p80c-rel was unique to G-CSF in that granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor which also stimulates neutrophils and induces tyrosine phosphorylation does not result in tyrosine phosphorylation of p80c-rel.
# T9 Protein S7 45 53 969 977 p80c-rel
# T10 Protein S7 68 73 992 997 G-CSF
# T11 Protein S7 82 130 1006 1054 granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor
# T12 Protein S7 249 257 1173 1181 p80c-rel

The consequences of p80c-rel tyrosine phosphorylation are not yet known; however, tyrosine-phosphorylated p80c-rel is capable of binding to DNA, and G-CSF stimulation results in an increase in the amount of p80c-rel which binds to DNA.
# T13 Protein S8 20 28 1203 1211 p80c-rel
# T14 Protein S8 106 114 1289 1297 p80c-rel
# T15 Protein S8 149 154 1332 1337 G-CSF
# T16 Protein S8 207 215 1390 1398 p80c-rel

These results demonstrate that one of the first biochemical events which occurs in neutrophils following G-CSF stimulation, activation of a tyrosine kinase, leads directly to the tyrosine phosphorylation of p80c-rel.
# T17 Protein S9 105 110 1524 1529 G-CSF
# T18 Protein S9 207 215 1626 1634 p80c-rel

Thus, the tyrosine kinase activated by G-CSF appears to directly transduce a signal to a protein which functions as a transcriptional regulator.
