ICSAT overexpression is not sufficient to cause adult T-cell leukemia or multiple myeloma.

ICSAT (Interferon Consensus Sequence binding protein for Activated T cells) is a lymphocyte-specific member of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of transcription factors, originally identified through Southwestern screening of the ATL(Adult T-cell leukemia)-16T expression library.
# T2 Protein S2 0 5 92 97 ICSAT
# T3 Protein S2 7 74 99 166 Interferon Consensus Sequence binding protein for Activated T cells

In this study, we created transgenic mice overexpressing ICSAT in lymphocytes.
# T4 Protein S3 57 62 443 448 ICSAT

Although spontaneous tumorigenesis was not observed, IL-2 production with Concanavalin A stimulation was significantly increased in transgenic mice overexpressing ICSAT.
# T5 Protein S4 53 57 518 522 IL-2
# T6 Protein S4 163 168 628 633 ICSAT

ICSAT overexpression in lymphocytes seems insufficient for the leukemogenesis of ATL or multiple myeloma (MM), however, it may regulate T cell activation and its overexpression may lead to leukemogenesis via controlling IL-2 production.
# T7 Protein S5 0 5 635 640 ICSAT
# T8 Protein S5 220 224 855 859 IL-2
