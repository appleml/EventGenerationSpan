Interleukin-7 can induce the activation of Jak 1, Jak 3 and STAT 5 proteins in murine T cells.

# T2 Protein S1 43 48 43 48 Jak 1

The activation of Janus protein tyrosine kinases (Jak) and STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins has recently been linked to the signal transduction mechanism of several cytokines.

IL-7 was observed to induce a rapid and dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak 1 and Jak 3 and concomitantly, the tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of multiple STAT proteins.
# T5 Protein S3 0 4 304 308 IL-7
# T6 Protein S3 83 88 387 392 Jak 1
# T7 Protein S3 93 98 397 402 Jak 3

The STAT proteins utilized by IL-7 were identical to those induced by IL-2 and could be identified as various STAT 5 isoforms.
# T8 Protein S4 30 34 533 537 IL-7
# T9 Protein S4 70 74 573 577 IL-2

Moreover, the induction of both Jak 1 and 3, and STAT 5 activity strongly correlated with the growth-promoting effects of IL-7, suggesting that this signal transduction mechanism may play a key role in IL-7-induced proliferation.
