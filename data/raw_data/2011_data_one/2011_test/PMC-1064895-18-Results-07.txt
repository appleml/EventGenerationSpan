Activation of the NF-kappaB and activator protein-1 (AP-1) pathway in the IL-17 promoter region

To investigate further the intracellular signaling pathway activated by anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28, concanavalin A, PHA and IL-15, and responsible for inducing IL-17 expression, we performed an electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA) of NF-kappaB recognition sites in the promoters of IL-17.

# T5 Protein S2 113 116 209 212 PHA
# T6 Protein S2 121 126 217 222 IL-15
# T7 Protein S2 157 162 253 258 IL-17
# T8 Protein S2 286 291 382 387 IL-17

As shown in Fig. 7a, nuclear extracts from RA PBMC stimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 (lane 2) demonstrated increased binding of NF-kappaB to IL-17 promoters in comparison with that of controls (lane 1).
# T9 Protein S3 86 90 475 479 CD28
# T10 Protein S3 147 152 536 541 IL-17

A supershift assay demonstrated shifted bands in p65 and p50 (lanes 3 and 4) not in c-Rel (lane 5).
# T11 Protein S4 49 52 647 650 p65
# T12 Protein S4 57 60 655 658 p50
# T13 Protein S4 84 89 682 687 c-Rel

In normal PBMC the same pattern was observed, but the degree of NF-kappaB activation by anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 was less intense than that in RA PBMC (Fig. 7b).

To confirm the link between PI3K activity and NF-kappaB, we performed EMSA to determine the NF-kappaB binding activity after treatment with both LY294002 and PDTC.

Both agents block NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in the IL-17 promoter (Fig. 7c).
# T15 Protein S7 56 61 1079 1084 IL-17

Western blotting for IkappaB-alpha showed inhibition of degradation of IkappaB-alpha by LY294002 and PDTC at the same time (Fig. 7c).
# T16 Protein S8 21 34 1126 1139 IkappaB-alpha
# T17 Protein S8 71 84 1176 1189 IkappaB-alpha

In contrast, the AP-1 pathway was not activated by stimulation with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 (data not shown), demonstrating that NF-kappaB is the main intracellular signaling pathway in IL-17 production by activated PBMC from patients with RA.
