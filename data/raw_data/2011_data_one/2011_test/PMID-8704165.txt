Retinoic acid activates interferon regulatory factor-1 gene expression in myeloid cells.

All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) is the drug of choice in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).

ATRA induces both in vitro and in vivo differentiation of APL cells into mature granulocytes.

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in ATRA-dependent growth inhibition and cellular differentiation are not presently understood.

The NB4 cell line, which is derived from the bone marrow of a patient with APL during relapse, can be used as a model system to study the growth and differentiation of APL cells.

Because interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRF-1 and IRF-2) and other IFN-inducible gene products regulate cell growth, we analyzed the effects of ATRA on the expression of these genes.

# T3 Protein S6 55 60 665 670 IRF-2

We show that ATRA directly activates IRF-1 gene expression, followed by activation of IRF-2 and 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) gene expression with slower kinetics.

# T5 Protein S7 86 91 884 889 IRF-2

In addition to NB4 cells, ATRA also activated IRF-1 gene expression in HL-60, U937, and THP-1 cells, which all respond to ATRA by growth inhibition.

A more than additive increase in IRF-1 gene expression was seen with ATRA and IFN-gamma in NB4 cells.
# T7 Protein S9 33 38 1152 1157 IRF-1
# T8 Protein S9 78 87 1197 1206 IFN-gamma

ATRA did not activate nuclear factor kappa B or signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) activation pathways, suggesting that an alternate mechanism is involved in IRF-1 gene activation.

The ATRA-induced expression of IRF-1, an activator of transcription and repressor of transformation, may be one of the molecular mechanisms of ATRA-induced growth inhibition, and the basis for the synergistic actions of ATRA and IFNs in myeloid leukemia cells.
