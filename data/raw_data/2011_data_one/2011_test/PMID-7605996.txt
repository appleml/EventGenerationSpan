Heterogeneous expression of Epstein-Barr virus latent proteins in endemic Burkitt's lymphoma.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected cells may sustain three distinct forms of virus latency.

In lymphoblastoid cell lines, six EBV-encoded nuclear antigens (EBNA1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, -LP), three latent membrane proteins (LMP1, 2A, 2B), and two nuclear RNAs (EBERs) are expressed.
# T1 Protein S3 64 69 250 255 EBNA1
# T2 Protein S3 71 72 257 258 2
# T3 Protein S3 74 76 260 262 3A
# T4 Protein S3 78 80 264 266 3B
# T5 Protein S3 82 84 268 270 3C
# T6 Protein S3 86 89 272 275 -LP
# T7 Protein S3 124 128 310 314 LMP1
# T8 Protein S3 130 132 316 318 2A
# T9 Protein S3 134 136 320 322 2B

This form of latency, termed latency III, is also encountered in some posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders.

In EBV-positive cases of Hodgkin's disease, the EBERs, EBNA1, and the LMPs are expressed (latency II), whereas in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) only the EBERs and EBNA1 have been detected (latency I).
# T10 Protein S5 55 60 540 545 EBNA1
# T11 Protein S5 157 162 642 647 EBNA1

We have studied the expression of EBV proteins in 17 cases of EBV-positive endemic BL by immunohistology.

Expression of LMP1 was seen in variable proportions of tumor cells in two cases and EBNA2 was detected in some tumor cells in three other cases.
# T12 Protein S7 14 18 800 804 LMP1
# T13 Protein S7 84 89 870 875 EBNA2

Also, the BZLF1 trans-activator protein was expressed in a few tumor cells in 6 cases, indicating entry into the lytic cycle.
# T14 Protein S8 10 39 941 970 BZLF1 trans-activator protein

A phenotypic drift from latency I to latency III has been observed previously in some BL cell lines.

Our results suggest that a similar phenomenon may occur in BL in vivo and indicate that the operational definition of EBV latencies is not easily applied to human tumors.
