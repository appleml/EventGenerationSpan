EMSA and ChIP Assays Show that Sox6 Directly Binds to the epsilony Promoter
# T1 Protein S1 31 35 31 35 Sox6
# T2 Protein S1 58 66 58 66 epsilony

Sox6 might repress the epsilony promoter, either through direct physical contact with the promoter or by regulating intermediates affecting the epsilony promoter.
# T3 Protein S2 0 4 76 80 Sox6
# T4 Protein S2 23 31 99 107 epsilony
# T5 Protein S2 144 152 220 228 epsilony

To investigate whether Sox6 is directly associated with the epsilony promoter, we first performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using a c-Myc-tagged Sox6 in a reticulocyte lysate-based transcription/translation in vitro system.
# T6 Protein S3 23 27 262 266 Sox6
# T7 Protein S3 60 68 299 307 epsilony
# T8 Protein S3 151 156 390 395 c-Myc
# T9 Protein S3 164 168 403 407 Sox6

The probes used are listed in Figure 3A.

The 36-base pair (bp) WT probe corresponds to the critical region of the epsilony promoter defined in our promoter deletion analyses.
# T10 Protein S5 73 81 596 604 epsilony

This probe contains two consensus Sox/Sox6 binding sites.

Also included in our EMSA are three mutated probes that are, either truncated (M1), or mutated (M2 and M3) in Sox/Sox6 binding sites (Figure 3A).

Sox6 is able to physically associate with the 36-bp region (Figure 3B) within the epsilony promoter defined by the deletion analysis experiments (Figure 2C).
# T11 Protein S8 0 4 861 865 Sox6
# T12 Protein S8 82 90 943 951 epsilony

The 36-bp probe was shifted by the tagged Sox6 protein.
# T13 Protein S9 42 46 1061 1065 Sox6

Moreover, both c-Myc and Sox6 antibodies supershift the band, indicating that the binding is Sox6-specific.
# T14 Protein S10 15 20 1090 1095 c-Myc
# T15 Protein S10 25 29 1100 1104 Sox6
# T16 Protein S10 93 97 1168 1172 Sox6

To rule out the possibility that the c-Myc tag itself binds to the probe, an HA-tagged Sox6 was used in another EMSA that confirmed these results (Figure 3C).
# T17 Protein S11 37 42 1220 1225 c-Myc
# T18 Protein S11 77 79 1260 1262 HA
# T19 Protein S11 87 91 1270 1274 Sox6

Next, nuclear extracts from MEL cells were used in EMSA employing the same 36-bp probe.

MEL cells, a murine erythroleukemic cell line, express adult beta globins, but not epsilony [33].
# T20 Protein S13 61 73 1492 1504 beta globins
# T21 Protein S13 83 91 1514 1522 epsilony

Sox6 directly binds to this DNA sequence in MEL cells (Figure 3D).
# T22 Protein S14 0 4 1529 1533 Sox6

The intact consensus Sox/Sox6 binding sites of the DNA probe are required for the binding, as shown in the competition assay (Figure 3E).

Ablation of putative Sox/Sox6 binding sites (M1 and M3) abolish their ability to compete in EMSA (Figure 3E).

The M2 mutant probe may compete partially with WT binding.

To investigate the functional significance of the intact Sox/Sox6 binding sites, the epsilony promoter reporter constructs with mutagenized Sox/Sox6 binding sites were co-transfected with the Sox6 overexpression vector into GM979 cells.
# T23 Protein S18 85 93 1989 1997 epsilony
# T24 Protein S18 192 196 2096 2100 Sox6

Consistent with the EMSA results, the mutant epsilony promoter reporter constructs (with either one or both Sox/Sox6 binding sites mutagenized) do not result in significant promoter repression in transfection studies (Figure 3F).
# T25 Protein S19 45 53 2186 2194 epsilony

Thus, both sites are required for maximal repression of epsilony by Sox6, but not to the same degree.
# T26 Protein S20 56 64 2427 2435 epsilony
# T27 Protein S20 68 72 2439 2443 Sox6

We also tested whether Sox6 binds to the epsilony promoter in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (Figure 4).
# T28 Protein S21 23 27 2497 2501 Sox6
# T29 Protein S21 41 49 2515 2523 epsilony

The Sox6-containing complex was immunoprecipitated from MEL cells or from liver cells of 15.5 dpc WT mice using Sox6 antibody.
# T30 Protein S22 4 8 2600 2604 Sox6
# T31 Protein S22 112 116 2708 2712 Sox6

Figure 4 shows that the epsilony proximal promoter is readily immunoprecipitated with Sox6 antibody in both MEL cells and liver cells.
# T32 Protein S23 24 32 2747 2755 epsilony
# T33 Protein S23 86 90 2809 2813 Sox6

Normal IgG was used as a negative control (Figure 4A).

The above data (Figures 3 and 4) clearly indicate that Sox6 acts as a repressor of the epsilony gene by directly binding to the epsilony promoter, probably as a dimer.
# T34 Protein S25 55 59 2968 2972 Sox6
# T35 Protein S25 87 95 3000 3008 epsilony
# T36 Protein S25 128 136 3041 3049 epsilony
