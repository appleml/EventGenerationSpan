Latent membrane protein 1 of Epstein-Barr virus interacts with JAK3 and activates STAT proteins.
# T1 Protein S1 0 25 0 25 Latent membrane protein 1
# T2 Protein S1 63 67 63 67 JAK3

Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) acts like a permanently activated receptor of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor superfamily and is absolutely required for B cell immortalization by Epstein-Barr virus.
# T3 Protein S2 0 25 98 123 Latent membrane protein 1
# T4 Protein S2 27 31 125 129 LMP1

Molecular and biochemical approaches demonstrated that LMP1 usurps cellular signaling pathways resulting in the induction of NF-kappaB and AP-1 via two C-terminal activating regions.
# T5 Protein S3 55 59 362 366 LMP1

We demonstrate here that a third region encompassing a proline rich sequence within the 33 bp repetitive stretch of LMP1's C-terminus is required for the activation of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3).
# T6 Protein S4 116 120 606 610 LMP1
# T7 Protein S4 168 182 658 672 Janus kinase 3
# T8 Protein S4 184 188 674 678 JAK3

The interaction of LMP1 and JAK3 leads to the enhanced tyrosine auto/transphosphorylation of JAK3 within minutes after crosslinking of a conditional NGF-R:LMP1 chimera and is a prerequisite for the activation of STAT transcription factors.
# T9 Protein S5 19 23 700 704 LMP1
# T10 Protein S5 28 32 709 713 JAK3
# T11 Protein S5 93 97 774 778 JAK3
# T12 Protein S5 149 154 830 835 NGF-R
# T13 Protein S5 155 159 836 840 LMP1

These results reveal a novel activating region in the LMP1 C-terminus and identify the JAK/STAT pathway as a target of this viral integral membrane protein in B cells.
# T14 Protein S6 54 58 975 979 LMP1
