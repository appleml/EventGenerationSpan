Signal transduction through interferon-gamma receptor on human eosinophils.

BACKGROUND: We reported on the constitutive interferon-gamma receptor (IFN-gammaR) expression on eosinophils.

But signal transduction through IFN-gammaR on eosinophils remains to be elucidated.

In this study, we examined the involvement of the Jak/Stat pathway in the signaling of eosinophils after IFN-gammaR conjugation by the ligand binding.

METHODS: Purified peripheral eosinophils were stimulated with IFN-gamma at 37 degrees C for 1-60 min.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of IFN-gammaR, Jak1, Jak2, and Stat1alpha was examined by immunoblotting.
# T1 Protein S6 40 44 564 568 Jak1
# T2 Protein S6 46 50 570 574 Jak2
# T3 Protein S6 56 66 580 590 Stat1alpha

Gel-shift assay was also examined to show the formation of Stat1alpha-DNA complexes.
# T4 Protein S7 59 69 682 692 Stat1alpha

RESULTS: We show that binding of IFN-gamma to human eosinophils initiated a series of events that resulted in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of not only the IFN-gammaRalpha chain but also Jak1, Jak2, and Stat1alpha.
# T5 Protein S8 161 182 869 890 IFN-gammaRalpha chain
# T6 Protein S8 192 196 900 904 Jak1
# T7 Protein S8 198 202 906 910 Jak2
# T8 Protein S8 208 218 916 926 Stat1alpha

In addition, IFN-gamma enhanced the DNA-binding activity of Stat1alpha.
# T9 Protein S9 60 70 988 998 Stat1alpha

CONCLUSION: These data indicate that IFN-gamma affects eosinophils through its specific receptor and utilizes the Jak/Stat pathway as its mode of signaling.
