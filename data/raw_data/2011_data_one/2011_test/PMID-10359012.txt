Phorbol ester-induced mononuclear cell differentiation is blocked by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway contributes to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced mononuclear differentiation in the human myeloblastic leukemia ML-1 cells.

Upon TPA treatment, the activity of ERK1 and ERK2 rapidly increased, with maximal induction between 1 and 3 h, while ERK2 protein levels remained constant.
# T1 Protein S3 36 40 428 432 ERK1
# T2 Protein S3 45 49 437 441 ERK2
# T3 Protein S3 117 121 509 513 ERK2

The activity of JNK1 was also significantly induced, with JNK1 protein levels increasing moderately during exposure to TPA.
# T4 Protein S4 16 20 564 568 JNK1
# T5 Protein S4 58 62 606 610 JNK1

Treatment of cells with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), inhibited TPA-induced ERK2 activity.
# T6 Protein S5 126 130 798 802 ERK2

Furthermore, PD98059 completely blocked the TPA-induced differentiation of ML-1 cells, as assessed by a number of features associated with mononuclear differentiation including changes in morphology, nonspecific esterase activity, phagocytic ability, NADPH oxidase activity, mitochondrial respiration, and c-jun mRNA inducibility.
# T7 Protein S6 306 311 1119 1124 c-jun

We conclude that activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway is necessary for TPA-induced mononuclear cell differentiation.
