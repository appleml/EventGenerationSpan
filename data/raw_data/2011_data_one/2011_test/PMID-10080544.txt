Lineage-specific activation of STAT3 by interferon-gamma in human neutrophils.
# T1 Protein S1 31 36 31 36 STAT3
# T2 Protein S1 40 56 40 56 interferon-gamma

Binding of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to its heterodimeric receptor induces activation of the tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK2 followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1alpha.
# T3 Protein S2 11 27 91 107 interferon-gamma
# T4 Protein S2 29 38 109 118 IFN-gamma
# T5 Protein S2 113 117 193 197 JAK1
# T6 Protein S2 122 126 202 206 JAK2
# T7 Protein S2 167 177 247 257 STAT1alpha

Selective activation of STAT1alpha at the IFN-gamma receptor is achieved by specific interaction between a cytosolic tyrosine motif including Y440 in the IFN-gamma receptor alpha-chain and the SH2 domain of STAT1alpha.
# T8 Protein S3 24 34 283 293 STAT1alpha
# T9 Protein S3 42 51 301 310 IFN-gamma
# T10 Protein S3 154 184 413 443 IFN-gamma receptor alpha-chain
# T11 Protein S3 207 217 466 476 STAT1alpha

We demonstrate that, in addition to STAT1alpha, STAT3 is also activated by IFN-gamma in human neutrophils.
# T12 Protein S4 36 46 514 524 STAT1alpha
# T13 Protein S4 48 53 526 531 STAT3
# T14 Protein S4 75 84 553 562 IFN-gamma

The activation of STAT3 was not found in human eosinophils, monocytes, and HL-60 cells, although the STAT3 protein was expressed in these cells.
# T15 Protein S5 18 23 603 608 STAT3
# T16 Protein S5 101 106 686 691 STAT3

The cell type-specific activation of STAT3 by IFN-gamma was also observed in neutrophils that are differentiated in vitro from human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells.
# T17 Protein S6 37 42 767 772 STAT3
# T18 Protein S6 46 55 776 785 IFN-gamma
# T19 Protein S6 133 137 863 867 CD34

These results indicate that a single cytokine receptor can activate different STAT family members in a cell-specific manner, which might result in cell-specific gene transcription.
