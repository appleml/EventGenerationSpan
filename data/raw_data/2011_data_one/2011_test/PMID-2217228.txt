Circadian rhythm of glucocorticoid receptors in human peripheral leukocytes and their reactivity to glucocorticoids.
# T1 Protein S1 20 44 20 44 glucocorticoid receptors

1) There exists a CR of GR in human leukocytes, PMN, and monocytes with the peak values from 0400 to 0800 hr and the trough values between 2300 and 0000 hr.
# T2 Protein S2 24 26 142 144 GR

The difference between them was significant statistically.

2) The FI of the chemotactic migration rate of PMN by cortisol also showed diurnal changes which were synchronous with that of GR.
# T3 Protein S4 127 129 461 463 GR

This indicates that the CR of GR may be of functional significance.
# T4 Protein S5 30 32 495 497 GR

3) In Cushing's syndrome, the CR of GR was normal in spite of the fact that the CR of plasma cortisol was disturbed.
# T5 Protein S6 36 38 569 571 GR

This indicates the independency of the CR of GR from that of cortisol.
# T6 Protein S7 45 47 695 697 GR

4) In apoplexy caused by brain ischemia, the CR of GR was abolished in patients with basal lesions but preserved when the lesions were located in the cerebral cortex.
# T7 Protein S8 51 53 772 774 GR

These results strongly suggest that the main "circadian pacemaker" of GR is located in the basal brain, most probably in the suprachiasmatic nuclei as has been suggested for rodents.
# T8 Protein S9 70 72 958 960 GR
