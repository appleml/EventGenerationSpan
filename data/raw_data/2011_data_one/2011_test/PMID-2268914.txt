[Effect of the regimen of kidney-tonifying and qi-invigorating on aging changes of glucocorticoid receptor]
# T1 Protein S1 83 106 83 106 glucocorticoid receptor

The plasma cortisol concentration and the sites of glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) in the peripheral lymphocytes were measured in 32 healthy aged persons and 13 young adults.
# T2 Protein S2 51 74 160 183 glucocorticoid receptor
# T3 Protein S2 76 79 185 188 GCR

In animal experiment, GCR of spleen lymphocytic cell was also measured in 18 aged rats and 9 young rats.
# T4 Protein S3 22 25 304 307 GCR

The results showed that GCR was significantly lower in the aged persons or rats than that in the young while the plasma cortisol level didn't change with aging.
# T5 Protein S4 24 27 411 414 GCR

So we think that GCR is more sensitive than the plasma cortisol level to reflect the aging change of the adrenal cortex function.
# T6 Protein S5 17 20 565 568 GCR

After the treatment with the regimen of Kidney-tonifying and Qi-invigorating, the GCR of the aged persons and rats was enhanced, and in this way, the function of the aged adrenal cortex was improved.
# T7 Protein S6 82 85 760 763 GCR
