Cellular and molecular mechanisms of IFN-gamma production induced by IL-2 and IL-12 in a human NK cell line.
# T1 Protein S1 37 46 37 46 IFN-gamma
# T2 Protein S1 69 73 69 73 IL-2

Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is an important immunoregulatory protein produced predominantly by T cells and large granular lymphocytes (LGL) in response to different extracellular signals.
# T3 Protein S2 0 16 110 126 Interferon-gamma
# T4 Protein S2 18 27 128 137 IFN-gamma

In particular, two interleukins (ILs), IL-2 and IL-12, have been shown to be potent inducers of IFN-gamma gene expression in both T cells and LGL.
# T5 Protein S3 39 43 338 342 IL-2
# T6 Protein S3 96 105 395 404 IFN-gamma

Although it has been reported that there are some T cell lines that produce IFN-gamma in response to IL-2 and IL-12 stimulation, there has as yet been no report of a natural killer (NK) cell line that responds in a similar manner.
# T7 Protein S4 76 85 522 531 IFN-gamma
# T8 Protein S4 101 105 547 551 IL-2

In this report we present evidence that the cell line NK3.3 derived from human NK cells, responds to both IL-2 and IL-12, as measured by increases in IFN-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) cytoplasmic mRNA and protein expression.
# T9 Protein S5 106 110 783 787 IL-2
# T10 Protein S5 150 159 827 836 IFN-gamma
# T11 Protein S5 164 212 841 889 granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
# T12 Protein S5 214 220 891 897 GM-CSF

In addition, when used together IL-2 and IL-12 synergized in the induction of IFN-gamma and GM-CSF and this synergy was attributed to an increased accumulation and stability of the IFN-gamma and GM-CSF mRNAs.
# T13 Protein S6 32 36 972 976 IL-2
# T14 Protein S6 78 87 1018 1027 IFN-gamma
# T15 Protein S6 92 98 1032 1038 GM-CSF
# T16 Protein S6 181 190 1121 1130 IFN-gamma
# T17 Protein S6 195 201 1135 1141 GM-CSF

To investigate the signaling pathways involved in the gene induction, five inhibitors, cyclosporin A (CsA), transforming growth factor-beta, cycloheximide, genistein, and staurosporine A, were used in analyzing the effects of IL-2 and IL-12 on NK3.3 cells.
# T18 Protein S7 108 139 1257 1288 transforming growth factor-beta
# T19 Protein S7 226 230 1375 1379 IL-2

The results suggest that activation of protein kinase C, but not new protein synthesis, is required for IL-2 induction of IFN-gamma and GM-CSF cytoplasmic mRNA.
# T20 Protein S8 104 108 1510 1514 IL-2
# T21 Protein S8 122 131 1528 1537 IFN-gamma
# T22 Protein S8 136 142 1542 1548 GM-CSF

In contrast, IL-12 induction of IFN-gamma cytoplasmic mRNA appears to only partially depend on activation of protein kinase C. Furthermore, both transforming growth factor-beta and genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, could suppress IL-2 and IL-12 signaling but CsA was generally inactive.
# T23 Protein S9 32 41 1599 1608 IFN-gamma
# T24 Protein S9 236 240 1803 1807 IL-2

It also was observed that suppression of cytokine gene expression by these agents was independent of the inhibition of proliferation.

In addition, IL-2 but not IL-12 induced nuclear factors NF-kappa B and AP1, and regulation of the nuclear levels of these two DNA binding protein complexes is correlated with IFN-gamma and GM-CSF gene expression.
# T25 Protein S11 13 17 2007 2011 IL-2
# T26 Protein S11 175 184 2169 2178 IFN-gamma
# T27 Protein S11 189 195 2183 2189 GM-CSF

These data indicate that IL-2 and IL-12 may have distinct signaling pathways leading to the induction of IFN-gamma and GM-CSF gene expression, and that the NK3.3 cell line may serve as a novel model for dissecting the biochemical and molecular events involved in these pathways.
# T28 Protein S12 25 29 2232 2236 IL-2
# T29 Protein S12 105 114 2312 2321 IFN-gamma
# T30 Protein S12 119 125 2326 2332 GM-CSF
