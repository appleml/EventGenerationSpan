Interleukin-6 production in hemorrhagic shock is accompanied by neutrophil recruitment and lung injury.

Hemorrhagic shock (HS) initiates an inflammatory cascade that includes the production of cytokines and recruitment of neutrophils (PMN) and may progress to organ failure, inducing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

To examine the hypothesis that interleukin-6 (IL-6) contributes to PMN infiltration and lung damage in HS, we examined the lungs of rats subjected to unresuscitated and resuscitated HS for the production of IL-6 and activation of Stat3.
# T2 Protein S3 31 44 360 373 interleukin-6
# T3 Protein S3 46 50 375 379 IL-6
# T4 Protein S3 207 211 536 540 IL-6
# T5 Protein S3 230 235 559 564 Stat3

Using semiquantitative RT-PCR, we found a striking increase in IL-6 mRNA levels only in resuscitated HS, with peak levels observed 1 h after initiation of resuscitation.
# T6 Protein S4 63 67 629 633 IL-6

Increased IL-6 protein expression was localized to bronchial and alveolar cells.
# T7 Protein S5 10 14 746 750 IL-6

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of protein extracts from shock lungs exhibited an increase in Stat3 activation with kinetics similar to IL-6 mRNA.
# T8 Protein S6 99 104 916 921 Stat3
# T9 Protein S6 141 145 958 962 IL-6

In situ DNA binding assay determined Stat3 activation predominantly within alveoli.
# T10 Protein S7 37 42 1006 1011 Stat3

Intratracheal instillation of IL-6 alone into normal rats resulted in PMN infiltration into lung interstitium and alveoli, marked elevation of bronchoalveolar lavage cellularity, and increased wet-to-dry ratio.
# T11 Protein S8 30 34 1083 1087 IL-6

These findings indicate that IL-6 production and Stat3 activation occur early in HS and may contribute to PMN-mediated lung injury, including ARDS after HS.
