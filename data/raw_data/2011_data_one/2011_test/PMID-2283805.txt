[Glucocorticoid receptors in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with bronchial asthma]
# T1 Protein S1 1 25 1 25 Glucocorticoid receptors

Quantitation of glucocorticoid receptors (GCR) and the study of their affinity for glucocorticosteroids (GCS) were made in peripheral blood lymphocytes of bronchial asthma (BA) patients in consideration of GCR treatment and serum levels of endogenous cortisol.
# T2 Protein S2 16 40 110 134 glucocorticoid receptors
# T3 Protein S2 42 45 136 139 GCR
# T4 Protein S2 206 209 300 303 GCR

It is stated that GCR of healthy controls and GCS-untreated patients outnumbered those of cortisol-dependent BA patients on hormone therapy.
# T5 Protein S3 18 21 373 376 GCR

Following discontinuation of glucocorticoid drugs GCR count in cortisol-dependent BA tends to rise.
# T6 Protein S4 50 53 546 549 GCR

Endogenous cortisol has no effect on GCR level estimated by 3H-triamcinolone acetonide.
# T7 Protein S5 37 40 633 636 GCR
