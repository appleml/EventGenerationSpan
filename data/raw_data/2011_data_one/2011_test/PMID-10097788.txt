PROBLEM: The mechanisms of the immunosuppressive and immunosuppression-inducing capacities of Jeg-3 human choriocarcinoma cell line supernatants (HCSs) are not yet completely understood.

The influence on interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4 and interferon (IFN)-gamma production; IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) alpha-, beta-, and gamma-chain; and the signaling pathway molecules Janus kinase (Jak)1, Jak3, signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat)1, Stat3, and Stat5 should be investigated.

# T4 Protein S3 37 41 385 389 IL-4
# T5 Protein S3 46 68 394 416 interferon (IFN)-gamma
# T6 Protein S3 171 190 519 538 Janus kinase (Jak)1
# T7 Protein S3 192 196 540 544 Jak3
# T8 Protein S3 198 256 546 604 signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat)1
# T9 Protein S3 258 263 606 611 Stat3
# T10 Protein S3 269 274 617 622 Stat5

METHOD OF STUDY: For assessment of IL production, whole peripheral venous blood from healthy donors was stimulated with phorbol-myristate-acetate and ionomycine.

Secretion of ILs was blocked with monensine.

Intracellular ILs were analyzed by flow cytometry.

For IL-2R and signaling pathway molecule analysis, peripheral blood lymphocytes were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA).
# T11 Protein S7 101 119 1006 1024 phytohemagglutinin
# T12 Protein S7 121 124 1026 1029 PHA

IL-2R chains were measured by flow cytometry, and Jaks/Stats by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot.

RESULTS: Phorbol-myristate-acetate and ionomycine strongly increase the percent-age of IL-2+ cells; an additional 50% HCSs significantly suppresses the percentage to, or below the level of unstimulated cells.
# T13 Protein S9 87 91 1270 1274 IL-2

IFN-gamma production is strongly decreased by HCSs in some cases, but not in others.
# T14 Protein S10 0 9 1392 1401 IFN-gamma

PHA stimulates IL-2R alpha-, beta-, and gamma-chain expression and their signaling pathway molecules Jak1, Jak3, Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5.

# T16 Protein S11 15 27 1492 1504 IL-2R alpha-

# T18 Protein S11 40 51 1517 1528 gamma-chain
# T19 Protein S11 101 105 1578 1582 Jak1
# T20 Protein S11 107 111 1584 1588 Jak3
# T21 Protein S11 113 118 1590 1595 Stat1
# T22 Protein S11 120 125 1597 1602 Stat3
# T23 Protein S11 131 136 1608 1613 Stat5

50% HCS downregulates the alpha-chain and slightly upregulates the beta-chain.

Jak1, Jak3, Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5 expression is suppressed approximately to, or below the level of unstimulated cells.

# T25 Protein S13 6 10 1700 1704 Jak3
# T26 Protein S13 12 17 1706 1711 Stat1
# T27 Protein S13 19 24 1713 1718 Stat3
# T28 Protein S13 30 35 1724 1729 Stat5

CONCLUSIONS: HCS forcefully blocks the production of IL-2; the IL-2R alpha-chain; and Jak1, Jak3, Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5 expression.

The observed phenomena might be caused by downregulation of an IL-2R regulation gene, and might play a key role in the expansion of choriocarcinoma, and possibly in the survival of the fetal allograft.
