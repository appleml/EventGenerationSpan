Cytokine profile of human PBMC following a 48 h in vitro stimulation with LPS, TSST-1, GP, GP + LPS and GP + TSST-1
# T1 Protein S1 79 85 79 85 TSST-1
# T2 Protein S1 109 115 109 115 TSST-1

Because of the GP-induced band shifts to seven sites from the TNFalpha, IL-8, IL-6 and IFNgamma promoters, it could be assumed that GP treatment of human PBMC would lead to production of TNFalpha, IL-8, IL-6, IFNgamma and other pro-inflammatory mediators.
# T3 Protein S2 62 70 178 186 TNFalpha
# T4 Protein S2 72 76 188 192 IL-8
# T5 Protein S2 78 82 194 198 IL-6
# T6 Protein S2 87 95 203 211 IFNgamma
# T7 Protein S2 187 195 303 311 TNFalpha
# T8 Protein S2 197 201 313 317 IL-8
# T9 Protein S2 203 207 319 323 IL-6
# T10 Protein S2 209 217 325 333 IFNgamma

Previous studies reported that beta-1-->3-D-glucans induced only a limited cytokine secretion of human blood cells [15-18].

Corroborating and extending these singular findings in terms of examining pro- (eight) as well as anti- (three) inflammatory cytokines over time (48 h) and six additional transcription factor binding sites, our comprehensive analysis revealed the following cytokine profile of human leukocytes in response to a highly purified water soluble beta-1-->3-D-glucan and in comparison to two pro-inflammatory mediators (LPS, TSST-1):
# T11 Protein S4 419 425 915 921 TSST-1

(i) IL-1beta
# T12 Protein S5 4 12 929 937 IL-1beta

There was no IL-1beta production detectable following PBMC treatment with 1 nor 100 mug GP.
# T13 Protein S6 13 21 951 959 IL-1beta

An insignificant up-regulation of IL-1beta production for GP + LPS was observed in comparison with LPS.
# T14 Protein S7 34 42 1064 1072 IL-1beta

For GP + TSST-1 we found a significant reduction in IL-1beta from 18 h - 24 h, for the latter by about 40% when compared to TSST-1 or the theoretical value of GP/TSST-1 calc.
# T15 Protein S8 9 15 1143 1149 TSST-1
# T16 Protein S8 52 60 1186 1194 IL-1beta
# T17 Protein S8 124 130 1258 1264 TSST-1
# T18 Protein S8 162 168 1296 1302 TSST-1

(n = 6; both p = 0.01).

On the whole, GP mediated a reduction of the TSST-1-induced amount of IL-1beta by about 50% (Fig. 3A).
# T19 Protein S10 45 51 1378 1384 TSST-1
# T20 Protein S10 70 78 1403 1411 IL-1beta

(ii) IL-6
# T21 Protein S11 5 9 1442 1446 IL-6

GP induced only a small amount of IL-6 and there was no significant alteration of the LPS-induced IL-6 production by GP.
# T22 Protein S12 34 38 1481 1485 IL-6
# T23 Protein S12 98 102 1545 1549 IL-6

On the contrary, we observed a decreased IL-6 production for GP + TSST-1 when compared to TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc., especially at 24 h by about 40% (n = 5; both p = 0.02), (data not shown in detail).
# T24 Protein S13 41 45 1609 1613 IL-6
# T25 Protein S13 66 72 1634 1640 TSST-1
# T26 Protein S13 90 96 1658 1664 TSST-1
# T27 Protein S13 103 109 1671 1677 TSST-1

(iii) IL-8
# T28 Protein S14 6 10 1776 1780 IL-8

We found that GP induced a substantial IL-8 production, in comparison with medium control, especially at 24 h (n = 13; p < 0.01).
# T29 Protein S15 39 43 1820 1824 IL-8

A combination of GP and LPS resulted in a non-significant increase of IL-8 production when compared to LPS or GP/LPS calc.
# T30 Protein S16 70 74 1981 1985 IL-8

There was no significant alteration in IL-8 production following GP + TSST-1 when compared to TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc.
# T31 Protein S17 39 43 2073 2077 IL-8
# T32 Protein S17 70 76 2104 2110 TSST-1
# T33 Protein S17 94 100 2128 2134 TSST-1
# T34 Protein S17 107 113 2141 2147 TSST-1

(data not shown in detail).

(iv) IL-1RA
# T35 Protein S19 5 11 2188 2194 IL-1RA

Besides IL-8, IL-1RA was the only mediator which was produced in significant quantities following GP treatment, especially at 24 h (n = 14, p < 0.01).
# T36 Protein S20 8 12 2203 2207 IL-8
# T37 Protein S20 14 20 2209 2215 IL-1RA

When compared to LPS stimulation or GP/LPS calc., GP + LPS did not alter the kinetic course of the IL-1RA production.
# T38 Protein S21 99 105 2445 2451 IL-1RA

However, following GP + TSST-1 we found a synergistic increase in IL-1RA production from 18 h to 48 h, when compared to TSST-1 (for instance at 24 h: n = 6; p = 0.01) or to the theoretical value of GP/TSST-1 calc.
# T39 Protein S22 24 30 2488 2494 TSST-1
# T40 Protein S22 66 72 2530 2536 IL-1RA
# T41 Protein S22 120 126 2584 2590 TSST-1
# T42 Protein S22 201 207 2665 2671 TSST-1

(from 18 h to 36 h).

Over the time course of 48 h, GP elevated the TSST-1-induced amount of IL-1RA by approximately 200% (Fig. 3B).
# T43 Protein S24 46 52 2745 2751 TSST-1
# T44 Protein S24 71 77 2770 2776 IL-1RA

Positive correlation between GP-induced IL-8 and IL-1RA productions.
# T45 Protein S25 40 44 2851 2855 IL-8
# T46 Protein S25 49 55 2860 2866 IL-1RA

Following stimulation with GP (24 h), we observed a positive correlation between IL-8 and IL-1RA.
# T47 Protein S26 81 85 2961 2965 IL-8
# T48 Protein S26 90 96 2970 2976 IL-1RA

Moreover, we found this correlation to be dose-dependent, since 100 mug of GP induced larger amounts of IL-8 and IL-1RA than 1 mug GP (n = 5, p </= 0.002, r = 0.9 and 0.98, respectively).
# T49 Protein S27 104 108 3082 3086 IL-8
# T50 Protein S27 113 119 3091 3097 IL-1RA

(v) TNFalpha
# T51 Protein S28 4 12 3171 3179 TNFalpha

With respect to TNFalpha production, 100 mug of GP yielded minor, statistically not distinguishable amounts, when compared to medium control.
# T52 Protein S29 16 24 3196 3204 TNFalpha

GP + LPS did not change the TNFalpha production when compared to LPS supplementation or GP/LPS calc.
# T53 Protein S30 28 36 3350 3358 TNFalpha

When combined with TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc., GP seemed to exert a synergistic effect on TNFalpha secretion after 36 h (n = 3; p < 0.05), but overall an enhancement of only 10% was observed (p > 0.05; data not shown in detail).
# T54 Protein S31 19 25 3442 3448 TSST-1
# T55 Protein S31 32 38 3455 3461 TSST-1
# T56 Protein S31 89 97 3512 3520 TNFalpha

(vi) IFNgamma
# T57 Protein S32 5 13 3657 3665 IFNgamma

No IFNgamma production was detectable following treatment of PBMC with 100 mug GP.
# T58 Protein S33 3 11 3669 3677 IFNgamma

There was a minor increase in IFNgamma production following GP + LPS at 36 h, when compared to LPS or GP/LPS calc., and a slight down-regulation following GP + TSST-1 at 24 h and 36 h, when compared to TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc.
# T59 Protein S34 30 38 3779 3787 IFNgamma
# T60 Protein S34 160 166 3909 3915 TSST-1
# T61 Protein S34 202 208 3951 3957 TSST-1
# T62 Protein S34 215 221 3964 3970 TSST-1

(data not shown).

(vii) IL-2, IL-12, IL-4, IL-10, TGFbeta1
# T63 Protein S36 6 10 4002 4006 IL-2
# T64 Protein S36 12 17 4008 4013 IL-12
# T65 Protein S36 19 23 4015 4019 IL-4
# T66 Protein S36 25 30 4021 4026 IL-10
# T67 Protein S36 32 40 4028 4036 TGFbeta1

The production of IL-2, IL-12, IL-4, IL-10 and TGFbeta 1 was not induced by GP.
# T68 Protein S37 18 22 4055 4059 IL-2
# T69 Protein S37 24 29 4061 4066 IL-12
# T70 Protein S37 31 35 4068 4072 IL-4
# T71 Protein S37 37 42 4074 4079 IL-10
# T72 Protein S37 47 56 4084 4093 TGFbeta 1

There were also no significant differences between medium control, LPS, TSST-1, GP, GP + LPS, GP/LPS calc. and GP + TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc. over 48 h (data not shown).
# T73 Protein S38 72 78 4189 4195 TSST-1
# T74 Protein S39 116 122 4233 4239 TSST-1
# T75 Protein S39 129 135 4246 4252 TSST-1
