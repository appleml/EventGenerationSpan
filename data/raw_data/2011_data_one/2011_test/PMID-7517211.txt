We have identified and characterized a previously unrecognized form of acute leukemia that shares features of both myeloid and natural killer (NK) cells.

From a consecutive series of 350 cases of adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we identified 20 cases (6%) with a unique immunophenotype: CD33+, CD56+, CD11a+, CD13lo, CD15lo, CD34+/-, HLA-DR-, CD16-.
# T4 Protein S3 145 149 515 519 CD33
# T5 Protein S3 152 156 522 526 CD56
# T6 Protein S3 159 164 529 534 CD11a
# T7 Protein S3 167 173 537 543 CD13lo
# T8 Protein S3 175 181 545 551 CD15lo
# T9 Protein S3 183 187 553 557 CD34
# T10 Protein S3 201 205 571 575 CD16

Multicolor flow cytometric assays confirmed the coexpression of myeloid (CD33, CD13, CD15) and NK cell-associated (CD56) antigens in each case, whereas reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays confirmed the identity of CD56 (neural cell adhesion molecule) in leukemic blasts.

# T12 Protein S4 79 83 657 661 CD13
# T13 Protein S4 85 89 663 667 CD15
# T14 Protein S4 115 119 693 697 CD56
# T15 Protein S4 242 246 820 824 CD56

Although two cases expressed CD4, no case expressed CD2, CD3, or CD8 and no case showed clonal rearrangement of genes encoding the T-cell receptor (TCR beta, gamma, delta).
# T16 Protein S5 29 32 906 909 CD4
# T17 Protein S5 52 55 929 932 CD2
# T18 Protein S5 65 68 942 945 CD8
# T19 Protein S5 148 156 1025 1033 TCR beta
# T20 Protein S5 158 163 1035 1040 gamma
# T21 Protein S5 165 170 1042 1047 delta

Leukemic blasts in the majority of cases shared unique morphologic features (deeply invaginated nuclear membranes, scant cytoplasm with fine azurophilic granularity, and finely granular Sudan black B and myeloperoxidase cytochemical reactivity) that were remarkably similar to those of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL); particularly the microgranular variant (FAB AML-M3v).

However, all 20 cases lacked the t(15;17) and 17 cases tested lacked the promyelocytic/retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) fusion transcript in RT-PCR assays; 12 cases had 46,XX or 46,XY karyotypes, whereas 2 cases had abnormalities of chromosome 17q: 1 with del(17)(q25) and the other with t(11;17)(q23;q21) and the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger/RAR alpha fusion transcript.
# T23 Protein S7 73 115 1499 1541 promyelocytic/retinoic acid receptor alpha
# T24 Protein S7 117 126 1543 1552 RAR alpha
# T25 Protein S7 322 356 1748 1782 promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger
# T26 Protein S7 357 366 1783 1792 RAR alpha

All cases tested (6/20), including the case with t(11;17), failed to differentiate in vitro in response to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), suggesting that these cases may account for some APLs that have not shown a clinical response to ATRA.

Four of 6 cases tested showed functional NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting a relationship between these unique CD33+, CD56+, CD16- acute leukemias and normal CD56+, CD16- NK precursor cells.

# T30 Protein S9 166 170 2220 2224 CD56
# T31 Protein S9 173 177 2227 2231 CD16

Using a combination of panning and multiparameter flow cytometric sorting, we identified a normal CD56+, CD33+, CD16- counterpart cell at a frequency of 1% to 2% in the peripheral blood of healthy individuals.

Our studies suggest that this form of acute leukemia may arise from transformation of a precursor cell common to both the myeloid and NK cell lineages; thus we propose the designation myeloid/NK acute leukemia.

Recognition of this new leukemic entity will be important in distinguishing these ATRA-nonresponsive cases from ATRA-responsive true APL.
