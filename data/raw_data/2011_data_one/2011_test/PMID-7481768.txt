Males with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) have defects in the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gamma c) gene that encodes a shared, essential component of the receptors of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15.
# T3 Protein S2 88 117 178 207 cytokine receptor gamma chain
# T4 Protein S2 119 126 209 216 gamma c
# T5 Protein S2 196 209 286 299 interleukin-2
# T6 Protein S2 211 215 301 305 IL-2
# T7 Protein S2 218 222 308 312 IL-4
# T8 Protein S2 224 228 314 318 IL-7
# T9 Protein S2 230 234 320 324 IL-9
# T10 Protein S2 240 245 330 335 IL-15

The Janus family tyrosine kinase Jak3 is the only signaling molecule known to be associated with gamma c, so it was hypothesized that defects in Jak3 might cause an XSCID-like phenotype.

A girl with immunological features indistinguishable from those of XSCID was therefore selected for analysis.

An Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed cell line derived from her lymphocytes had normal gamma c expression but lacked Jak3 protein and had greatly diminished Jak3 messenger RNA.
# T14 Protein S5 90 97 724 731 gamma c
# T15 Protein S5 120 124 754 758 Jak3
# T16 Protein S5 160 164 794 798 Jak3

Sequencing revealed a different mutation on each allele: a single nucleotide insertion resulting in a frame shift and premature termination in the Jak3 JH4 domain and a nonsense mutation in the Jak3 JH2 domain.
# T17 Protein S6 147 151 961 965 Jak3
# T18 Protein S6 194 198 1008 1012 Jak3

The lack of Jak3 expression correlated with impaired B cell signaling, as demonstrated by the inability of IL-4 to activate Stat6 in the EBV-transformed cell line from the patient.
# T19 Protein S7 12 16 1037 1041 Jak3
# T20 Protein S7 107 111 1132 1136 IL-4
# T21 Protein S7 124 129 1149 1154 Stat6

These observations indicate that the functions of gamma c are dependent on Jak3 and that Jak3 is essential for lymphoid development and signaling.
# T22 Protein S8 50 57 1256 1263 gamma c
# T23 Protein S8 75 79 1281 1285 Jak3
# T24 Protein S8 89 93 1295 1299 Jak3
