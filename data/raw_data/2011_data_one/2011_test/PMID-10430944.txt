The Epstein-Barr virus latency BamHI-Q promoter is positively regulated by STATs and Zta interference with JAK/STAT activation leads to loss of BamHI-Q promoter activity.

In Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumors in nonimmunocompromised patients, EBV gene expression is highly restricted.

EBV-encoded nuclear antigen (EBNA)-1 is expressed, whereas the immunogenic and proliferative EBNAs are not.
# T2 Protein S3 0 36 294 330 EBV-encoded nuclear antigen (EBNA)-1

This pattern of EBNA expression is generated by usage of the BamHI-Q promoter (Qp).

We have determined that the JAK/STAT pathway positively regulates Qp activity.

In transient-transfection assays, a Qp-CAT reporter was activated by cotransfected JAK-1 and by treatment of cells with the cytokine IL-6.
# T3 Protein S6 83 88 648 653 JAK-1
# T4 Protein S6 133 137 698 702 IL-6

The ability of Qp to bind signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins was directly demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility-shift assay, and mutation of potential STAT-binding sites reduced Qp responsiveness to Janus kinase (JAK)-1.
# T5 Protein S7 232 252 936 956 Janus kinase (JAK)-1

Consistent with a role for STATs in Qp function, Qp using Burkitt's lymphoma Rael cells and cultured nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells contained nuclear STAT protein.

We investigated whether the inability to maintain EBV-positive NPC cell lines in culture was related to Qp activity.

Passaging of the NPC cell line HK666 led to activation of expression of BZLF1, which encodes Zta and loss of Qp function.
# T6 Protein S10 72 77 1317 1322 BZLF1
# T7 Protein S10 93 96 1338 1341 Zta

Transient expression assays linked Zta expression to the down-regulation of Qp.
# T8 Protein S11 35 38 1402 1405 Zta

Cotransfection of Zta reduced Qp activity in reporter assays.
# T9 Protein S12 18 21 1465 1468 Zta

This negative regulation required Zta DNA-binding activity.
# T10 Protein S13 34 37 1543 1546 Zta

We provide evidence that Zta up-regulation of p53 leads to p53-mediated interference with JAK/STAT activation of Qp.
# T11 Protein S14 25 28 1594 1597 Zta
# T12 Protein S14 46 49 1615 1618 p53
# T13 Protein S14 59 62 1628 1631 p53

The data imply that JAK/STAT signaling has a role in EBV-associated malignancies.
