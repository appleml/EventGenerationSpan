Nuclear NF-ATp is a hallmark of unstimulated B cells from B-CLL patients.

B lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) were analysed for the nuclear presence and DNA binding of a panel of transcription factors which are involved in the gene control of lymphoid cells.

The following transcription factors were studied: the Octamer factors Oct-1 and Oct-2, members of the AP-1 factor family, NF-AT factors, in particular NF-ATp, and members of the Rel/NF-kB family.
# T2 Protein S3 70 75 387 392 Oct-1
# T3 Protein S3 80 85 397 402 Oct-2
# T4 Protein S3 151 157 468 474 NF-ATp

We show that the constitutive nuclear translocation of NF-ATp, a member of the growing family of NF-AT factors, is a hallmark of nonstimulated B cells from CLL patients that distinguishes B-CLL cells from 'normal' B lymphocytes.

Constitutive nuclear appearance was also observed for NF-kB2/p52.
# T6 Protein S5 61 64 803 806 p52

Constitutive binding of further factor proteins to DNA, such as JunD, c-Fos and FosB, was detected in several patients whereas the localisation and DNA binding of other factors such as c-Jun, RelA/p65 and c-Rel was unaltered.
# T7 Protein S6 64 68 872 876 JunD
# T8 Protein S6 70 75 878 883 c-Fos
# T9 Protein S6 80 84 888 892 FosB
# T10 Protein S6 185 190 993 998 c-Jun
# T11 Protein S6 192 196 1000 1004 RelA
# T12 Protein S6 197 200 1005 1008 p65
# T13 Protein S6 205 210 1013 1018 c-Rel

It is remarkable that in B-CLL cells the nuclear appearance and DNA binding of specific transcription factors is dramatically affected whereas other members of the same factor family remained unaltered in these leukemic cells.

It remains to be shown which molecular events lead to the specific 'pre-activation', i.e. constitutive nuclear translocation and DNA binding, of these members of NF-AT, NF-kB and AP-1 factor families.
