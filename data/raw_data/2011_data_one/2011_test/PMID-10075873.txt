Detection of intracellular phosphorylated STAT-1 by flow cytometry.
# T1 Protein S1 42 48 42 48 STAT-1

We have applied flow cytometry to the investigation of interferon-gamma activation of human monocytes.
# T2 Protein S2 55 71 124 140 interferon-gamma

This approach uses monoclonal antibodies that distinguish between the native and phosphorylated forms of STAT-1.
# T3 Protein S3 105 111 277 283 STAT-1

It enables rapid and quantitative assessment of STAT-1 phosphorylation on a discrete cell basis and is both more sensitive and less time consuming than immunoblotting.
# T4 Protein S4 48 54 333 339 STAT-1

Furthermore, it allows for discrimination between a mixture of cells that differ in their response to interferon-gamma.
# T5 Protein S5 102 118 555 571 interferon-gamma

This approach should allow for the evaluation of different intracellular signaling pathways using a combination of monoclonal reagents that are specific for native and activation modified proteins.

Application of this form of testing should prove valuable in screening for signaling defects in selected patients with recurrent infections.

In addition, this technique should permit dissection of a full range of cellular signaling pathways at the protein level.
