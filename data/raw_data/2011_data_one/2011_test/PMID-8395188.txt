Tumor necrosis factor receptor expression and signal transduction in HIV-1-infected cells.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the inter-relationship between HIV-1 infection and the cell surface receptors for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, an immunoregulatory cytokine that can enhance HIV-1 replication.
# T1 Protein S2 104 137 196 229 tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha

DESIGN: Infected promyelocytic and promonocytic cells were examined because they normally express both types of TNF receptors.

METHODS: TNF receptor surface expression was determined by specific monoclonal antibody recognition and flow cytometry, and signal transduction was detected by gel shift analysis.

HIV-1 activation and expression was quantitated by reverse transcriptase assay.
# T2 Protein S5 51 72 654 675 reverse transcriptase

RESULTS: In the OM-10.1 promyelocytic model of chronic infection, TNF-alpha-induced HIV-1 expression also resulted in a substantial increase in 75 kd TNF receptor (TR75) expression although 55 kD TNF receptor (TR55) levels were not dramatically altered.
# T3 Protein S6 66 75 749 758 TNF-alpha
# T4 Protein S6 144 162 827 845 75 kd TNF receptor
# T5 Protein S6 164 168 847 851 TR75
# T6 Protein S6 190 208 873 891 55 kD TNF receptor
# T7 Protein S6 210 214 893 897 TR55

A series of uninfected parental HL-60 subclones all reduced TR75 surface expression in response to TNF-alpha treatment.
# T8 Protein S7 60 64 997 1001 TR75
# T9 Protein S7 99 108 1036 1045 TNF-alpha

Enhanced TR75 expression on OM-10.1 cells followed the same TNF-alpha-dose dependency as that observed for HIV-1 production.
# T10 Protein S8 9 13 1066 1070 TR75
# T11 Protein S8 60 69 1117 1126 TNF-alpha

An increase in TR75 expression was also evident during the peak of an acute HIV-1 infection of HL-60 promyelocytes.
# T12 Protein S9 15 19 1197 1201 TR75

Although TR55 expression was unaltered during TNF-alpha-induced HIV activation, this receptor was still involved in the viral activation process.
# T13 Protein S10 9 13 1307 1311 TR55
# T14 Protein S10 46 55 1344 1353 TNF-alpha

Antibody cross-linking of TR55, in the absence of exogenous TNF-alpha, induced maximal HIV-1 expression, an up-modulation of surface TR75, and nuclear NF-kappa B activity in OM-10.1 cultures.
# T15 Protein S11 26 30 1470 1474 TR55
# T16 Protein S11 60 69 1504 1513 TNF-alpha
# T17 Protein S11 133 137 1577 1581 TR75

Surprisingly, this was the case even when an antagonistic anti-TR55 antibody was used.
# T18 Protein S12 63 67 1699 1703 TR55

Anti-TR55 antibody cross-linking in chronically infected U1 promonocytic cultures could only partially substitute for TNF-alpha-induced HIV-1 expression.
# T19 Protein S13 5 9 1728 1732 TR55
# T20 Protein S13 118 127 1841 1850 TNF-alpha

CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that HIV-1 infection can selectively influence the surface expression of TNF receptors, potentially influencing its own expression and altering normal immunoregulatory signal transduction.
