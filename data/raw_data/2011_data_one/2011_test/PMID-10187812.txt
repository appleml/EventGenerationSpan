Spi-C, a novel Ets protein that is temporally regulated during B lymphocyte development.
# T1 Protein S1 0 5 0 5 Spi-C

A novel Ets protein was isolated by yeast one-hybrid screening of a cDNA library made from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse splenic B cells, using the SP6 kappa promoter kappaY element as a bait.

The novel Ets protein was most closely related to PU.1 and Spi-B within the DNA binding Ets domain and was therefore named Spi-C.

# T3 Protein S3 59 64 348 353 Spi-B
# T4 Protein S3 123 128 412 417 Spi-C

However, Spi-C may represent a novel subgroup within the Ets protein family, as it differed significantly from Spi-B and PU.1 within helix 1 of the Ets domain.

# T6 Protein S4 111 116 530 535 Spi-B
# T7 Protein S4 121 125 540 544 PU.1

Spi-C was encoded by a single-copy gene that was mapped to chromosome 10, region C. Spi-C interacted with DNA similarly to PU.1 as judged by methylation interference, band-shift and site selection analysis, and activated transcription of a kappaY element reporter gene upon co-transfection of HeLa cells.

# T9 Protein S5 84 89 663 668 Spi-C
# T10 Protein S5 123 127 702 706 PU.1

Spi-C RNA was expressed in mature B lymphocytes and at lower levels in macrophages.
# T11 Protein S6 0 5 884 889 Spi-C

Furthermore, pre-B cell and plasma cell lines were Spi-C-negative, suggesting that Spi-C might be a regulatory molecule during a specific phase of B lymphoid development.
