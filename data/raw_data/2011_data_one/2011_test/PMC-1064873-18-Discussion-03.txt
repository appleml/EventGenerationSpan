STAT3 activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of RA.
# T1 Protein S1 0 5 0 5 STAT3

Active STAT3 is constitutively expressed in synovial fluid mononuclear cells from RA patients [36].
# T2 Protein S2 7 12 71 76 STAT3

IL-6 is the major STAT3-activating factor present in synovial fluid, which has a crucial role in the activation of monocyte functions such as gene expression of the Fc gamma receptor type I and type III and of HLA-DR [31].
# T3 Protein S3 0 4 164 168 IL-6
# T4 Protein S3 18 23 182 187 STAT3
# T5 Protein S3 35 41 199 205 factor
# T6 Protein S3 69 74 233 238 which
# T7 Protein S3 165 189 329 353 Fc gamma receptor type I
# T8 Protein S3 194 202 358 366 type III

More recently, high levels of activated STAT3, thought to be induced mainly by IL-6, have been detected in the ST, and STAT3 activation has been shown to be involved in synovial fibroblast proliferation and IL-6 production [37].
# T9 Protein S4 40 45 427 432 STAT3
# T10 Protein S4 79 83 466 470 IL-6
# T11 Protein S4 119 124 506 511 STAT3
# T12 Protein S4 207 211 594 598 IL-6

In this regard, STAT3 is critical in the survival and expansion of growth factor-dependent synovial fibroblasts [38].
# T13 Protein S5 16 21 632 637 STAT3

Furthermore, the significance of persistent STAT3 signaling in Th1-cell-dominated autoimmune arthritis has been suggested by studies of the gp130F759/F759 mice, in which the Src homology phosphatase-2 binding site of gp130 (the transmembrane glycoprotein beta subunit of the IL-6 family cytokine receptor), tyrosine 759, was mutated to phenylalanine [39].
# T14 Protein S6 44 49 778 783 STAT3
# T15 Protein S6 140 145 874 879 gp130
# T16 Protein S6 217 222 951 956 gp130
# T17 Protein S6 228 304 962 1038 transmembrane glycoprotein beta subunit of the IL-6 family cytokine receptor

In the gp130F759/F759 mice, T cells, particularly the CD4+ T-cell subset, are chronically activated and resistant to activation-induced cell death through gp130-mediated STAT3 activation.
# T18 Protein S7 7 12 1097 1102 gp130
# T19 Protein S7 54 57 1144 1147 CD4
# T20 Protein S7 155 160 1245 1250 gp130
# T21 Protein S7 170 175 1260 1265 STAT3

The longevity of cytokine signals transduced by the JAK-STAT pathway is regulated by the SOCS family proteins [7].

We found that CD4+ T cells from patients with active RA expressed higher levels of SOCS1, but lower levels of SOCS3, compared with normal CD4+ T cells.
# T22 Protein S9 14 17 1408 1411 CD4
# T23 Protein S9 83 88 1477 1482 SOCS1
# T24 Protein S9 110 115 1504 1509 SOCS3
# T25 Protein S9 138 141 1532 1535 CD4

SOCS1 prevents activation of JAK by directly binding to JAK, and SOCS3 inhibits the action of JAK by binding to the Src homology phosphatase-2-binding domain of receptors such as gp130 [40].
# T26 Protein S10 0 5 1546 1551 SOCS1
# T27 Protein S10 65 70 1611 1616 SOCS3
# T28 Protein S10 161 170 1707 1716 receptors
# T29 Protein S10 179 184 1725 1730 gp130

SOCS1 and SOCS3 are induced by various cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-10, as mediators of negative feedback and crosstalk inhibition [7].
# T30 Protein S11 0 5 1737 1742 SOCS1
# T31 Protein S11 10 15 1747 1752 SOCS3
# T32 Protein S11 31 48 1768 1785 various cytokines
# T33 Protein S11 60 64 1797 1801 IL-6
# T34 Protein S11 69 74 1806 1811 IL-10

Recent studies with mice lacking SOCS3 or SOCS1 revealed that SOCS3 is a negative regulator of IL-6 signaling but not of IL-10 signaling.
# T35 Protein S12 33 38 1910 1915 SOCS3
# T36 Protein S12 42 47 1919 1924 SOCS1
# T37 Protein S12 62 67 1939 1944 SOCS3
# T38 Protein S12 95 99 1972 1976 IL-6
# T39 Protein S12 121 126 1998 2003 IL-10

Studies of conditional SOCS3-deficient mice have shown that SOCS3 deficiency, but not SOCS1 deficiency, results in sustained activation of STAT3 in response to IL-6 [8,41].
# T40 Protein S13 23 28 2038 2043 SOCS3
# T41 Protein S13 60 65 2075 2080 SOCS3
# T42 Protein S13 86 91 2101 2106 SOCS1
# T43 Protein S13 139 144 2154 2159 STAT3
# T44 Protein S13 160 164 2175 2179 IL-6

The analysis of SOCS3-deficient macrophages has indicated that SOCS3 is a crucial inhibitor of the IL-6-induced transcriptional response [42].
# T45 Protein S14 16 21 2204 2209 SOCS3
# T46 Protein S14 63 68 2251 2256 SOCS3
# T47 Protein S14 99 103 2287 2291 IL-6

However, SOCS3 is dispensable for both the negative feedback inhibition and the immunoregulatory action of IL-10 in macrophages [41].
# T48 Protein S15 9 14 2340 2345 SOCS3
# T49 Protein S15 107 112 2438 2443 IL-10

On the contrary, SOCS1 was found to directly inhibit IL-10-mediated signaling [43].
# T50 Protein S16 17 22 2482 2487 SOCS1
# T51 Protein S16 53 58 2518 2523 IL-10

Increased SOCS1 expression in RA CD4+ T cells may therefore be associated with both the impaired responsiveness to IL-10 and to IL-10-mediated STAT3 activation, and defective SOCS3 expression may be responsible for persistent STAT3 activation in response to serum IL-6.
# T52 Protein S17 10 15 2559 2564 SOCS1
# T53 Protein S17 33 36 2582 2585 CD4
# T54 Protein S17 115 120 2664 2669 IL-10

# T59 Protein S17 264 268 2813 2817 IL-6

There is a possibility that SOCS1 induction may be associated with the ability of CD4+ T cells to produce IFN-gamma, because CD4+ T cells from active RA could produce high levels of IFN-gamma in the presence of IL-10, and because IFN-gamma has been known as a potent inducer of SOCS1 [32].
# T60 Protein S18 28 33 2848 2853 SOCS1
# T61 Protein S18 82 85 2902 2905 CD4
# T62 Protein S18 106 115 2926 2935 IFN-gamma

# T66 Protein S18 230 239 3050 3059 IFN-gamma
# T67 Protein S18 278 283 3098 3103 SOCS1

It is of interest in this regard to indicate that polarized Th1 and Th2 cells express high levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA, respectively [44].
# T68 Protein S19 101 106 3211 3216 SOCS1
# T69 Protein S19 111 116 3221 3226 SOCS3

IL-12-induced STAT4 activation is inhibited by SOCS3 induction in Th2 cells, whereas IL-4-induced STAT6 signaling is diminished by SOCS1 induction in Th1 cells.
# T70 Protein S20 0 5 3252 3257 IL-12
# T71 Protein S20 14 19 3266 3271 STAT4
# T72 Protein S20 47 52 3299 3304 SOCS3
# T73 Protein S20 85 89 3337 3341 IL-4
# T74 Protein S20 98 103 3350 3355 STAT6
# T75 Protein S20 131 136 3383 3388 SOCS1

SOCS1 and SOCS3 may thus have important roles as Th1-specific and Th2-specific, mutually exclusive, cross-talk repressors of the IL-4-STAT6 and the IL-12-STAT4 signaling pathways, respectively.
# T76 Protein S21 0 5 3413 3418 SOCS1

# T79 Protein S21 134 139 3547 3552 STAT6

# T81 Protein S21 154 159 3567 3572 STAT4

Consistent with this notion, PB T cells from patients with allergic diseases significantly express high levels of SOCS3 transcripts, and the SOCS3 expression correlates well with serum IgE levels and disease pathology [45].
# T82 Protein S22 114 119 3721 3726 SOCS3
# T83 Protein S22 141 146 3748 3753 SOCS3

Higher SOCS1 expression with lower SOCS3 expression in PB CD4+ T cells from RA patients, compared with healthy controls, is therefore probably consistent with their systemic bias towards a Th1 phenotype, as has previously been demonstrated [46-49].
