Mice deficient for the 55 kd tumor necrosis factor receptor are resistant to endotoxic shock, yet succumb to L. monocytogenes infection.
# T1 Protein S1 23 59 23 59 55 kd tumor necrosis factor receptor

The multiple biological activities of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are mediated by two distinct cell surface receptors of 55 kd (TNFRp55) and 75 kd (TNFRp75).
# T2 Protein S2 128 135 266 273 TNFRp55
# T3 Protein S2 148 155 286 293 TNFRp75

Using gene targeting, we generated a TNFRp55-deficient mouse strain.
# T4 Protein S3 37 44 333 340 TNFRp55

Cells from TNFRp55-/-mutant mice lack expression of TNFRp55 but display normal numbers of high affinity TNFRp75 molecules.
# T5 Protein S4 11 18 376 383 TNFRp55
# T6 Protein S4 52 59 417 424 TNFRp55
# T7 Protein S4 104 111 469 476 TNFRp75

Thymocyte development and lymphocyte populations are unaltered, and clonal deletion of potentially self-reactive T cells is not impaired.

However, TNF signaling is largely abolished, as judged by the failure of TNF to induce NF-kappa B in T lymphocytes from TNFRp55-deficient mice.
# T8 Protein S6 120 127 746 753 TNFRp55

The loss of TNFRp55 function renders mice resistant to lethal dosages of either lipopolysaccharides or S. aureus enterotoxin B.
# T9 Protein S7 12 19 782 789 TNFRp55
# T10 Protein S7 113 126 883 896 enterotoxin B

In contrast, TNFRp55-deficient mice are severely impaired to clear L. monocytogenes and readily succumb to infection.
# T11 Protein S8 13 20 911 918 TNFRp55

Thus, the 55 kd TNFR plays a decisive role in the host's defense against microorganisms and their pathogenic factors.
# T12 Protein S9 10 20 1026 1036 55 kd TNFR
