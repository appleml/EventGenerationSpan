Diminished responses to IL-13 by human monocytes differentiated in vitro: role of the IL-13Ralpha1 chain and STAT6.
# T1 Protein S1 24 29 24 29 IL-13
# T2 Protein S1 86 104 86 104 IL-13Ralpha1 chain
# T3 Protein S1 109 114 109 114 STAT6

The primary IL-13 receptor complex on human monocytes is believed to be a heterodimer comprised of the IL-4R alpha chain and the IL-2R gamma chain (gamma(c))-like molecule, IL-13R alpha1.
# T4 Protein S2 12 17 129 134 IL-13
# T5 Protein S2 103 120 220 237 IL-4R alpha chain
# T6 Protein S2 129 146 246 263 IL-2R gamma chain
# T7 Protein S2 173 186 290 303 IL-13R alpha1

mRNA levels for IL-13R alpha1, but not IL-4R alpha, were markedly decreased in in vitro monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMac), and with increasing time of monocytes in culture correlated with the loss of IL-13 regulation of lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-alpha production.
# T8 Protein S3 16 29 321 334 IL-13R alpha1
# T9 Protein S3 39 50 344 355 IL-4R alpha
# T10 Protein S3 203 208 508 513 IL-13
# T11 Protein S3 250 259 555 564 TNF-alpha

Analysis of cell lines Daudi and THP-1 that differentially express gamma(c) and IL-13R alpha1 showed that IL-13 can activate STAT6 in IL-13R alpha1-positive THP-1 cells but not in gamma(c)-positive, IL-13R alpha1-negative Daudi cells.
# T12 Protein S4 80 93 657 670 IL-13R alpha1
# T13 Protein S4 106 111 683 688 IL-13
# T14 Protein S4 125 130 702 707 STAT6
# T15 Protein S4 134 147 711 724 IL-13R alpha1
# T16 Protein S4 199 212 776 789 IL-13R alpha1

IL-13 activation of STAT6 was reduced in MDMac which was associated with diminished IL-13-induced expression of CD23 and MHC class II.
# T17 Protein S5 0 5 812 817 IL-13
# T18 Protein S5 20 25 832 837 STAT6
# T19 Protein S5 84 89 896 901 IL-13
# T20 Protein S5 112 116 924 928 CD23

However, with reduced IL-13R alpha1 expression and low nuclear STAT6 activity, some IL-13-induced responses were unaltered in magnitude in MDMac.
# T21 Protein S6 22 35 969 982 IL-13R alpha1
# T22 Protein S6 63 68 1010 1015 STAT6
# T23 Protein S6 84 89 1031 1036 IL-13

In the absence of functional IL-13R alpha1 and gamma(c), IL-13 must signal through an alternative receptor complex on MDMac.
# T24 Protein S7 29 42 1122 1135 IL-13R alpha1
# T25 Protein S7 57 62 1150 1155 IL-13

Experiments with a blocking antibody to IL-4R alpha showed that this chain remains an essential component of the IL-13 receptor complex on MDMac.
# T26 Protein S8 40 51 1258 1269 IL-4R alpha
# T27 Protein S8 113 118 1331 1336 IL-13
