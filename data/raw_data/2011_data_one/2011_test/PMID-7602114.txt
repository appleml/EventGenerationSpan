The activation of the Jak-STAT 1 signaling pathway by IL-5 in eosinophils.
# T1 Protein S1 26 32 26 32 STAT 1
# T2 Protein S1 54 58 54 58 IL-5

The intracellular signal transduction of IL-5 in eosinophils is unknown.
# T3 Protein S2 41 45 117 121 IL-5

The objective of this study was to investigate the involvement of the newly discovered Jak-STAT pathway in the IL-5 signal transduction mechanism.
# T4 Protein S3 111 115 260 264 IL-5

Eosinophils were purified from peripheral blood by discontinuous Percoll gradients and stimulated with IL-5.
# T5 Protein S4 103 107 399 403 IL-5

The involvement of Jak 2 was investigated by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting for tyrosine phosphorylation.
# T6 Protein S5 19 24 424 429 Jak 2

The activation of Jak 2 was studied by autophosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated kinase.
# T7 Protein S6 18 23 545 550 Jak 2

Jak 2 was tyrosine phosphorylated within 1 to 3 min after stimulation of eosinophils with IL-5.
# T8 Protein S7 0 5 620 625 Jak 2
# T9 Protein S7 90 94 710 714 IL-5

Further, the immunoprecipitated Jak 2 obtained from IL-5-stimulated cells underwent autophosphorylation.
# T10 Protein S8 32 37 748 753 Jak 2
# T11 Protein S8 52 56 768 772 IL-5

Jak 2 coprecipitated with the beta-subunit of the IL-5 receptor, suggesting a physical association of the kinase with the receptor.
# T12 Protein S9 0 5 821 826 Jak 2

The nuclear factor STAT-1 (p91) was investigated by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting for tyrosine phosphorylation.
# T13 Protein S10 19 25 972 978 STAT-1
# T14 Protein S10 27 30 980 983 p91

STAT-1 was tyrosine phosphorylated within 15 min of IL-5 stimulation.
# T15 Protein S11 0 6 1082 1088 STAT-1
# T16 Protein S11 52 56 1134 1138 IL-5

The presence of STAT-1 in the nuclear extract was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assay.
# T17 Protein S12 16 22 1168 1174 STAT-1

IL-5 induced two proteins that bound to the gamma-activating sequence.
# T18 Protein S13 0 4 1251 1255 IL-5

In the presence of an anti-STAT-1 Ab, the band was supershifted.
# T19 Protein S14 27 33 1349 1355 STAT-1

Thus, we demonstrated that IL-5 activated the Jak 2-STAT 1 signaling pathway in eosinophils.
# T20 Protein S15 27 31 1414 1418 IL-5
# T21 Protein S15 46 51 1433 1438 Jak 2
# T22 Protein S15 52 58 1439 1445 STAT 1

We speculate that the Jak 2-STAT 1 pathway may be involved in the activation of IL-5-inducible genes in eosinophils.
# T23 Protein S16 22 27 1502 1507 Jak 2
# T24 Protein S16 28 34 1508 1514 STAT 1
# T25 Protein S16 80 84 1560 1564 IL-5
