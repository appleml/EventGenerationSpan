Increased expression of cell surface IL-10R1 on RA CD4+ T cells
# T1 Protein S1 37 44 37 44 IL-10R1
# T2 Protein S1 51 54 51 54 CD4

The functional receptor complex of IL-10 consists of two subunits, the primary ligand-binding component IL-10R1 and the accessory component type 2 IL-10R [1].
# T3 Protein S2 35 40 99 104 IL-10
# T4 Protein S2 53 65 117 129 two subunits
# T5 Protein S2 104 111 168 175 IL-10R1
# T6 Protein S2 140 153 204 217 type 2 IL-10R

IL-10R1 expression plays a critical role in cellular responses to IL-10 [29].
# T7 Protein S3 0 7 223 230 IL-10R1
# T8 Protein S3 66 71 289 294 IL-10

To examine whether the resistance to IL-10 inhibition in RA CD4+ T cells was due to limited receptor expression, the cell surface expression of IL-10R1 on PB CD4+ T cells from active RA patients and from healthy controls was determined by flow cytometric analysis.
# T9 Protein S4 37 42 338 343 IL-10
# T10 Protein S4 60 63 361 364 CD4
# T11 Protein S4 92 100 393 401 receptor
# T12 Protein S4 144 151 445 452 IL-10R1
# T13 Protein S4 158 161 459 462 CD4

As shown in Fig. 3a,3b, the intensity of IL-10R1 expression on CD4+ T cells was significantly increased in RA patients compared with in healthy controls.
# T14 Protein S5 41 48 607 614 IL-10R1
# T15 Protein S5 63 66 629 632 CD4

These results suggest that the intracellular signal transduction pathway of IL-10 may be impaired in CD4+ T cells of active RA.
