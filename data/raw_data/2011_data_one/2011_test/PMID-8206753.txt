Glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of interleukin-2 receptor alpha and -beta subunit expression by human T cells.
# T1 Protein S1 38 66 38 66 interleukin-2 receptor alpha
# T2 Protein S1 71 76 71 76 -beta

To determine the mechanism of glucocorticoid (GC)-mediated inhibition of T cell functions, the effect of dexamethasone (DM) on T cell proliferation and interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) generation were studied.

Dexamethasone inhibited IL-2-induced T cell proliferation by 30%-88%, relative to its concentration within the cultures.
# T3 Protein S3 24 28 347 351 IL-2

The effect of DM on expression of IL-2R alpha (Tac, p55, CD25) and beta (p75) genes in activated T cells was examined next.
# T4 Protein S4 34 45 478 489 IL-2R alpha
# T5 Protein S4 47 50 491 494 Tac
# T6 Protein S4 52 55 496 499 p55
# T7 Protein S4 57 61 501 505 CD25
# T8 Protein S4 67 71 511 515 beta
# T9 Protein S4 73 76 517 520 p75

In T cells stimulated with purified phytohemagglutinin (PHA-p) and 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) addition of DM to the cultures resulted in a 60% reduction in IL-2R alpha and a 30% reduction in IL-2R beta membrane expression compared to T cells cultured in the absence of DM (p < 0.01).
# T10 Protein S5 36 54 604 622 phytohemagglutinin
# T11 Protein S5 56 61 624 629 PHA-p
# T12 Protein S5 174 185 742 753 IL-2R alpha
# T13 Protein S5 209 219 777 787 IL-2R beta

Inhibition of membrane IL-2R alpha and IL-2R beta expression by 10(-6) M DM was partially reversible by recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2).
# T14 Protein S6 23 34 893 904 IL-2R alpha
# T15 Protein S6 39 49 909 919 IL-2R beta
# T16 Protein S6 122 126 992 996 IL-2

By Northern blot analysis, DM caused a comparable decrease in IL-2R alpha and in IL-2R beta mRNA levels to membrane receptor expression in mitogen-stimulated T cells.
# T17 Protein S7 62 73 1069 1080 IL-2R alpha
# T18 Protein S7 81 91 1088 1098 IL-2R beta

By in vitro transcription assays, DM regulated IL-2R alpha gene expression at a transcriptional level while transcription of IL-2R beta gene was unaffected by DM.
# T19 Protein S8 47 58 1221 1232 IL-2R alpha
# T20 Protein S8 125 135 1299 1309 IL-2R beta

The mechanism of action of DM on IL-2R alpha transcription was examined by determining the mRNA levels of the p50 subunit of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), a transcription factor that stimulates IL-2R alpha gene expression.
# T21 Protein S9 33 44 1370 1381 IL-2R alpha
# T22 Protein S9 110 113 1447 1450 p50
# T23 Protein S9 201 212 1538 1549 IL-2R alpha

The data indicate that 10(-6) M DM increased T cell p50 NF-kappa B mRNA levels by four-fold compared to the levels obtained in the absence of DM.
# T24 Protein S10 52 55 1619 1622 p50

Further, the level of nuclear proteins capable of binding to the NF-kappa B sites in activated T cells increased in response to DM.

In sum, DM regulates T cell membrane expression of IL-2R by more than one molecular mechanism.
