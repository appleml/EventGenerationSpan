HTLV-1 Tax induces expression of various immediate early serum responsive genes.

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is an etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL).

We showed here by mobility-shift assay that T-cell lines transformed with the virus contained high levels of AP-1 activities.

Consistent with this result, these cell lines expressed increased levels of mRNAs encoding the AP-1 proteins, c-Fos, Fra-1, c-Jun, JunB, and JunD.

# T3 Protein S4 117 122 425 430 Fra-1
# T4 Protein S4 124 129 432 437 c-Jun
# T5 Protein S4 131 135 439 443 JunB
# T6 Protein S4 141 145 449 453 JunD

Previously, transcription of the c-fos gene has been reported to be transactivated by the viral transcription factor, Tax1.
# T7 Protein S5 33 38 488 493 c-fos
# T8 Protein S5 118 122 573 577 Tax1

By using the human T-cell line (JPX-9), in which expression of the Tax1 is inducible, we showed that expression of mRNAs for Fra-1, c-Jun, and JunD was also transactivated by Tax1.

# T10 Protein S6 125 130 704 709 Fra-1
# T11 Protein S6 132 137 711 716 c-Jun
# T12 Protein S6 143 147 722 726 JunD
# T13 Protein S6 175 179 754 758 Tax1

Moreover, Tax1 activated expression of two other transcription factors having zinc finger motifs, Egr-1 and Egr-2, in the same cells.
# T14 Protein S7 10 14 770 774 Tax1
# T15 Protein S7 98 103 858 863 Egr-1
# T16 Protein S7 108 113 868 873 Egr-2

The Tax1-inducible transcription factors identified here are encoded by the members of immediate early genes under the control of growth signals.
# T17 Protein S8 4 8 898 902 Tax1

Thus, Tax1 was suggested to replace growth signals, at least in part, by this mechanism.
# T18 Protein S9 6 10 1046 1050 Tax1
