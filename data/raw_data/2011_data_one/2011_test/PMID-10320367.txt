Nuclear factor-90 of activated T-cells: A double-stranded RNA-binding protein and substrate for the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR.

NFAT transcription factors play a central role in initiating T-cell activation through the induction of immediate-early T-cell specific genes including interleukin-2 (IL-2).
# T3 Protein S2 152 165 304 317 interleukin-2
# T4 Protein S2 167 171 319 323 IL-2

NFAT transcription factors bind to a sequence in the IL-2 enhancer known as the antigen receptor response element 2 (ARRE-2).
# T5 Protein S3 53 57 379 383 IL-2

Multiple proteins exhibiting ARRE-2 binding activity have been isolated, including a heterodimer from stimulated T-cell nuclear extracts consisting of Mr = 90 000 (NF90) and Mr = 45 000 (NF45) subunits.
# T6 Protein S4 164 168 616 620 NF90
# T7 Protein S4 187 191 639 643 NF45

The subunits of this heterodimer have been cloned, and NF90 was found to encode a protein containing two domains that are predicted to form motifs capable of binding to double-stranded RNA.
# T8 Protein S5 55 59 710 714 NF90

Using in vitro translated polypeptides, we have demonstrated that NF90 specifically binds to double-stranded RNA.
# T9 Protein S6 66 70 911 915 NF90

Furthermore, NF90 was phosphorylated in a double-stranded RNA-dependent manner likely by the interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR.
# T10 Protein S7 13 17 972 976 NF90
# T11 Protein S7 151 157 1110 1116 kinase
# T12 Protein S7 159 162 1118 1121 PKR

The NF90 protein was found to be expressed not only in T-cells, but also in nonimmune HeLa cells.
# T13 Protein S8 4 8 1127 1131 NF90

In HeLa cells, the protein was almost exclusively localized to the ribosome salt wash fraction of cell lysates.
