Genes that regulate interleukin-4 expression in T cells.
# T1 Protein S1 20 33 20 33 interleukin-4

Interleukin-4 is an immunomodulatory cytokine which plays a central role in the regulation of allergic and atopic immune responses.
# T2 Protein S2 0 13 58 71 Interleukin-4

Significant progress has been made in gaining a detailed understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the interleukin-4 gene.
# T3 Protein S3 112 125 302 315 interleukin-4

The recent identification and characterization of several key transcription factors has helped to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of T helper cell cytokine gene expression.
