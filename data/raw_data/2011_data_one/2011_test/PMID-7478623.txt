Bik, a novel death-inducing protein shares a distinct sequence motif with Bcl-2 family proteins and interacts with viral and cellular survival-promoting proteins.
# T1 Protein S1 0 3 0 3 Bik

The survival-promoting activity of the Bcl-2 family of proteins appears to be modulated by interactions between various cellular proteins.

We have identified a novel cellular protein, Bik, that interacts with the cellular survival-promoting proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, as well as the viral survival-promoting proteins, Epstein Barr virus-BHRF1 and adenovirus E1B-19 kDa.
# T2 Protein S3 45 48 348 351 Bik
# T3 Protein S3 112 117 415 420 Bcl-2
# T4 Protein S3 122 128 425 431 Bcl-xL
# T5 Protein S3 199 204 502 507 BHRF1
# T6 Protein S3 220 230 523 533 E1B-19 kDa

In transient transfection assays, Bik promotes cell death in a manner similar to the death-promoting members of the Bcl-2 family, Bax and Bak.

# T8 Protein S4 130 133 665 668 Bax
# T9 Protein S4 138 141 673 676 Bak

This death-promoting activity of Bik can be suppressed by coexpression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, EBV-BHRF1 and E1B-19 kDa proteins suggesting that Bik may be a common target for both cellular and viral anti-apoptotic proteins.

# T13 Protein S5 89 98 767 776 EBV-BHRF1
# T14 Protein S5 139 142 817 820 Bik

While Bik does not show overt homology to the BH1 and BH2 conserved domains characteristic of the Bcl-2 family, it does share a 9 amino acid domain (BH3) with Bax and Bak which may be a critical determinant for the death-promoting activity of these proteins.
