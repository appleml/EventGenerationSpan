A microtitre assay system for glucocorticoid receptors: decreased receptor concentration in myocardial infarction.
# T1 Protein S1 30 54 30 54 glucocorticoid receptors

A major difficulty in determination of glucocorticoid receptor sites is the very complicated assay procedure.
# T2 Protein S2 39 62 155 178 glucocorticoid receptor

Therefore, we describe a microtitre assay system for glucocorticoid receptors which is a whole-cell competitive binding radioassay using [3H]-dexamethasone as radioligand.
# T3 Protein S3 53 77 279 303 glucocorticoid receptors

This modification of a previously described protocol simplifies and reduces laboratory work and allows assay reproducibility to be controlled more reliably.

Thus enabled to perform the test on multiple blood samples in parallel, we investigated cardiac infarction patients over a 12-day period to test if glucocorticoid receptor binding is altered in this 'stressful' disease.
# T4 Protein S5 148 171 703 726 glucocorticoid receptor

On the first day of the disease, glucocorticoid receptor capacity was significantly decreased without alteration of the receptor-ligand affinity, whereas on days 4 and 12 the number of receptor sites was normal again.
# T5 Protein S6 33 56 808 831 glucocorticoid receptor

This result fits well into the general observation of stress-induced down-regulation of immune responses.
