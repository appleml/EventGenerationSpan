Mutant p100H Mice Have Higher Numbers of Nucleated Red Cells

Among the other Sox6 effects in erythropoiesis, we have noticed that there are more nucleated red blood cells circulating in p100H mutant mice than in WT mice at 14.5 dpc and 18.5 dpc (Figure 7A).

However, at postnatal day 10.5, we do not see circulating nucleated red cells in either WT or mutant mice, suggesting that this may be a transient effect.

In addition, the mutant liver shows a significant increase in hematopoietic precursor cells including nucleated erythrocytes at 18.5 dpc (Figure 7B).

This alteration is noted as early as 14.5 dpc.

These observations suggest that besides silencing the epsilony globin gene, Sox6 may affect red cell maturation.

# T3 Protein S6 76 80 686 690 Sox6
