[The role of glucocorticoid receptors and HLA antigens in the pathogenesis of Cushing's syndrome]
# T1 Protein S1 13 37 13 37 glucocorticoid receptors

Lymphocytic levels of glucocorticoid receptors were evaluated in 114 patients suffering from Icenko-Cushing's syndrome.
# T2 Protein S2 22 46 121 145 glucocorticoid receptors

Incidence of HLA antigens was determined in 94 of them.

A significant rise of A10 and B27 antigen incidence compared to that in normal subjects allows these antigens to be considered genetic markers of Icenko-Cushing's syndrome.
# T3 Protein S4 22 25 297 300 A10
# T4 Protein S4 30 41 305 316 B27 antigen

The levels of glucocorticoid receptors in lymphocytes of the patients are lower than in normal subjects both in the active stage of the disease and following bilateral total adrenalectomy.
# T5 Protein S5 14 38 462 486 glucocorticoid receptors

The patients carrying B27 antigen had lymphocytic receptor concentrations under the levels of such in patients free of the antigen carriage.
# T6 Protein S6 22 33 659 670 B27 antigen

Antigen B27 seems to be a cause of lower levels of glucocorticoid receptors in blood lymphocytes.
# T7 Protein S7 0 11 778 789 Antigen B27
# T8 Protein S7 51 75 829 853 glucocorticoid receptors
