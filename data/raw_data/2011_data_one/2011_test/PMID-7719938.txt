The role of shared receptor motifs and common Stat proteins in the generation of cytokine pleiotropy and redundancy by IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-13, and IL-15.
# T1 Protein S1 119 123 119 123 IL-2
# T2 Protein S1 125 129 125 129 IL-4
# T3 Protein S1 131 135 131 135 IL-7
# T4 Protein S1 137 142 137 142 IL-13
# T5 Protein S1 148 153 148 153 IL-15

To understand the molecular bases for cytokine redundancy and pleiotropy, we have compared the Stat proteins activated in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) by cytokines with shared and distinct actions.

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) rapidly activated Stat5 in fresh PBL, and Stat3 and Stat5 in preactivated PBL.
# T6 Protein S3 0 13 361 374 Interleukin-2
# T7 Protein S3 15 19 376 380 IL-2
# T8 Protein S3 39 44 400 405 Stat5
# T9 Protein S3 63 68 424 429 Stat3
# T10 Protein S3 73 78 434 439 Stat5

IL-7 and IL-15 induced the same complexes as IL-2, a feature explained by the existence of similar tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of IL-2R beta and IL-7R that can serve as docking sites for Stat proteins.
# T11 Protein S4 0 4 461 465 IL-7
# T12 Protein S4 9 14 470 475 IL-15
# T13 Protein S4 45 49 506 510 IL-2
# T14 Protein S4 160 170 621 631 IL-2R beta
# T15 Protein S4 175 180 636 641 IL-7R

IL-13 Induced the same complexes as IL-4, a finding explained by our studies implicating IL-4R as a shared component of the receptors.
# T16 Protein S5 0 5 693 698 IL-13
# T17 Protein S5 36 40 729 733 IL-4
# T18 Protein S5 89 94 782 787 IL-4R

These studies demonstrate that a single cytokine can activate different combinations of Stat proteins under different physiological conditions, and also indicate two mechanisms by which distinct cytokines can activate the same Stat protein.
