Cytomegalovirus modulates interleukin-6 gene expression.

Complications after lung transplantation include the development of rejection and an increased incidence of infection, particularly with cytomegalovirus (CMV).

Several recent studies have suggested that interleukin (IL)-6 may be used to detect both infection and rejection after lung transplantation.
# T2 Protein S3 43 61 261 279 interleukin (IL)-6

In addition, IL-6 may play a role in the development of bronchiolitis obliterans after transplantation.
# T3 Protein S4 13 17 372 376 IL-6

Because CMV is also associated with the development of bronchiolitis obliterans after transplantation, we determined whether CMV induces IL-6 gene expression.
# T4 Protein S5 137 141 600 604 IL-6

We demonstrated that CMV infection increased both IL-6 protein and mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
# T5 Protein S6 50 54 672 676 IL-6

We also demonstrated that the CMV immediate early 1 gene product increased expression of the IL-6 promoter.
# T6 Protein S7 34 51 767 784 immediate early 1
# T7 Protein S7 93 97 826 830 IL-6

This effect of the CMV immediate early 1 gene product was dependent upon the presence of specific transcription factor binding sites in the IL-6 promoter.
# T8 Protein S8 23 40 864 881 immediate early 1
# T9 Protein S8 140 144 981 985 IL-6

These studies demonstrate that CMV may be an important cofactor in the development of rejection and infection after transplantation through its effects on IL-6.
# T10 Protein S9 155 159 1151 1155 IL-6
