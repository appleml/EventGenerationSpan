STAT3 is activated by many cytokines and growth factors such as the IL-6 family of cytokines (IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin M), platelet-derived growth factor, and epidermal growth factor, in addition to IL-10 [4], but previous studies have demonstrated that IL-6 is the major factor in RA synovial fluid that induces constitutive activation of STAT3 in mononuclear cells [31].

Since IL-6 is also abundant in sera of active RA patients, frequently detected at > 1 ng/ml [27], we examined whether persistent exposure of CD4+ T cells to high concentrations of IL-6 in the blood circulation was responsible for their sustained STAT3 activation and resistance to IL-10 inhibition in active RA.

# T23 Protein S3 281 286 775 780 IL-10

Both STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation was activated by IL-6 in normal CD4+ T cells (data not shown), in agreement with previous observations [4].

Normal CD4+ T cells were thus incubated for 20 min with culture medium containing 30% serum from active RA patients and neutralizing anti-IL-6 antibody or control antibody, and STAT phosphorylation was examined by western blot analysis.

# T29 Protein S5 138 142 1089 1093 IL-6

RA serum was able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 but not STAT1, and this STAT3 activation was mostly abolished by neutralization of IL-6 activity (Fig. 5a).
# T30 Protein S6 56 61 1244 1249 STAT3
# T31 Protein S6 70 75 1258 1263 STAT1
# T32 Protein S6 86 91 1274 1279 STAT3
# T33 Protein S6 145 149 1333 1337 IL-6

These results indicate that IL-6 is the dominant STAT3-activating factor contained in sera of active RA patients.

# T35 Protein S7 49 54 1407 1412 STAT3

The lack of STAT1 activation by RA serum suggests that much higher concentrations of IL-6 may be required for STAT1 activation as compared with STAT3 activation, or that inhibitors of STAT1 signaling may be present in RA serum.

We next examined whether IL-6 could suppress the effect of IL-10 to inhibit IFN-gamma production by CD4+ T cells.

# T45 Protein S9 100 103 1801 1804 CD4

After preincubation with or without 10 ng/ml IL-6 for 36 hours, normal CD4+ T cells were stimulated by CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence or absence of 1 ng/ml IL-10 for 36 hours, and the IFN-gamma production was measured by ELISA.
# T46 Protein S10 45 49 1860 1864 IL-6
# T47 Protein S10 71 74 1886 1889 CD4
# T48 Protein S10 111 115 1926 1930 CD28
# T49 Protein S10 168 173 1983 1988 IL-10
# T50 Protein S10 196 205 2011 2020 IFN-gamma

IL-6 pretreatment of normal cells reduced IL-10-mediated inhibition of IFN-gamma production (Fig. 5b), indicating that high concentrations of IL-6 could modulate T-cell responsiveness to IL-10.
# T51 Protein S11 0 4 2055 2059 IL-6
# T52 Protein S11 42 47 2097 2102 IL-10

# T55 Protein S11 187 192 2242 2247 IL-10

Taken together, these findings suggest that persistent exposure to serum IL-6 may have a role in both the induction of STAT3 activation and the resistance to the inhibitory effect of IL-10 in RA CD4+ T cells.
