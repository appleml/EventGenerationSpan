UV-induced CYP1A1 gene expression in human cells is mediated by tryptophan.
# T1 Protein S1 11 17 11 17 CYP1A1

Induction of cytochrome P-4501A1 (CYP1A1) activity by UV has been observed earlier in animal studies via a mechanism that has not yet been resolved.
# T2 Protein S2 13 32 90 109 cytochrome P-4501A1
# T3 Protein S2 34 40 111 117 CYP1A1

Our previous data have indicated that formylated indolocarbazoles which are formed by UV irradiation of tryptophan solutions are very potent Ah-receptor agonists.
# T4 Protein S3 141 152 367 378 Ah-receptor

To evaluate the effect of UV light on cytochrome P4501A1 gene expression, we studied the induction of CYP1A1 mRNA by UV irradiation of cultured human keratinocytes (HaCaT cell line), primary human blood lymphocytes and mouse Hepa-1 cells.
# T5 Protein S4 38 56 427 445 cytochrome P4501A1
# T6 Protein S4 102 108 491 497 CYP1A1

The cells were exposed to UV light delivered by a bank of 6 Philips TL20/12RS sun lamps emitting primarily in the UVB range in the absence and presence of tryptophan.

A semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-linked polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used for analysis of gene expression in the treated cells.

The results show that the CYP1A1 mRNA level induced by UV in the presence of tryptophan was higher than that induced by UV alone in both HaCaT cells and lymphocytes after 3 h of incubation post-UV irradiation.

To find out if the induction by UV light is caused by the formation of an Ah receptor ligand, Hepa-1 wild-type and Ah receptor deficient c12 cell lines were applied.
# T8 Protein S8 74 85 1225 1236 Ah receptor
# T9 Protein S8 115 126 1266 1277 Ah receptor

Wild-type (wt) cells were inducible either by the tryptophan photoproduct 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ) or by UV-irradiation but very low or undetectable levels were observed in the c12 cells.

This shows that the induction of gene expression by FICZ and UV is Ah receptor dependent.
# T10 Protein S10 67 78 1585 1596 Ah receptor

Together, these results indicate that UV-induced CYP1A1 gene expression in mammalian cells is mediated by an Ah receptor ligand formed from tryptophan.
# T11 Protein S11 49 55 1657 1663 CYP1A1
# T12 Protein S11 109 120 1717 1728 Ah receptor

Thus, the photoproducts of tryptophan are suggested to be mediators of light via binding to the Ah receptor and as such also could have a role in light-regulated biological rhythms.
