Osteoclast markers accumulate on cells developing from human peripheral blood mononuclear precursors.

Recent studies show that human osteoclasts develop in vitro from hematopoietic cells; however, special cultures conditions and/or cytokine mobilized peripheral blood are apparently required.

Here, we report that cells expressing osteoclast markers differentiate from precursors present in nonmobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), without the addition of stromal cells, growth factors, cytokines or steroids; and characterize their phenotype.

Three days after establishing high-density PBMC cultures (1.5 x 10(6) cells/cm2), in serum-containing medium, small adherent colonies of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase positive (TRAP+) cells emerge, amidst massive monocyte cell death.
# T1 Protein S4 183 187 743 747 TRAP

These adherent cells have an eccentrically placed, round nucleus, and express low levels of TRAP and sodium fluoride-resistant- alpha-naphthyl-acetate-esterase (NaF-R-NSE).
# T2 Protein S5 92 96 892 896 TRAP

Over the next week, this cell population accumulates phenotypic markers of osteoclasts (vitronectin receptor [VR], calcitonin receptor, TRAP, cathepsin K protein, and mRNA) with increased nuclearity, covering the entire surface by 15 days.
# T3 Protein S6 136 140 1109 1113 TRAP
# T4 Protein S6 142 153 1115 1126 cathepsin K

When cultured on bone, VR+, TRAP+ cells of low multinuclearity appear and cover up to 50% of the surface.
# T5 Protein S7 28 32 1241 1245 TRAP

Resorption lacunae can be observed by day 22.

Although these pits are not nearly as numerous as the cells of preosteoclast phenotype, they do represent the activity of a subset of osteoclast-like cells that has achieved osteoclastic maturity under these culture conditions.

Transcripts for osteoprotegerin ligand (OPGL), an osteoclast differentiation factor (also known as RANKL and TRANCE) are expressed, likely by adherent cells.
# T6 Protein S10 16 38 1609 1631 osteoprotegerin ligand
# T7 Protein S10 40 44 1633 1637 OPGL
# T8 Protein S10 99 104 1692 1697 RANKL
# T9 Protein S10 109 115 1702 1708 TRANCE

Thus, an adherent population of cells, with preosteoclast/osteoclast phenotypic properties, arises selectively under simple culture conditions from normal PBMC.

Further characterization of these cells should identify factors involved in the growth, terminal differentiation and activation of osteoclasts.
