Sp1 functions in a chromatin-dependent manner to augment human alpha-globin promoter activity.
# T1 Protein S1 0 3 0 3 Sp1
# T2 Protein S1 63 75 63 75 alpha-globin

The 5' flanking region of the human alpha-globin gene is highly G + C rich and contains multiple copies of the consensus sequence for the Sp1 binding site.
# T3 Protein S2 36 48 132 144 alpha-globin
# T4 Protein S2 138 141 234 237 Sp1

We investigated the role of this G + C-rich region in augmenting alpha-globin promoter activity in the presence of the far-upstream alpha-globin enhancer, HS-40.
# T5 Protein S3 65 77 317 329 alpha-globin
# T6 Protein S3 132 144 384 396 alpha-globin
# T7 Protein S3 155 160 407 412 HS-40

We show that in transiently transfected erythroid cells, deletion of the alpha-globin G + C-rich 5' flanking region has no effect on alpha-globin promoter activity.
# T8 Protein S4 73 85 487 499 alpha-globin
# T9 Protein S4 133 145 547 559 alpha-globin

However, upon stable integration into chromatin, deletion of this region causes a nearly 90% decrease in promoter activity compared with expression from an alpha-globin promoter retaining this region.
# T10 Protein S5 156 168 735 747 alpha-globin

These results suggest that the alpha-globin G + C-rich 5' flanking region augments alpha-globin promoter activity in a chromatin-dependent manner.
# T11 Protein S6 31 43 811 823 alpha-globin
# T12 Protein S6 83 95 863 875 alpha-globin

We further show that this G + C-rich region is required for the activation of alpha-globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation.
# T13 Protein S7 78 90 1005 1017 alpha-globin

Finally, we show by both footprint analysis and functional assays that the ability of the G + C-rich region to increase alpha-globin promoter activity from a stably integrated alpha-globin gene is mediated by its multiple binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1.
# T14 Protein S8 120 132 1188 1200 alpha-globin
# T15 Protein S8 176 188 1244 1256 alpha-globin
# T16 Protein S8 265 268 1333 1336 Sp1
