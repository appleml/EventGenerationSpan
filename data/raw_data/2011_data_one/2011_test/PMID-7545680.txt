Direct demonstration of NFATp dephosphorylation and nuclear localization in activated HT-2 cells using a specific NFATp polyclonal antibody.

Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) regulates transcription of a number of cytokine genes, and NFAT DNA binding activity is stimulated following T cell activation.

Several lines of evidence have suggested that NFAT is a substrate for calcineurin, a serine/threonine phosphatase.

Using a polyclonal antibody to murine NFATp, Western blot analysis of various mouse tissues demonstrated that the 110-130-kDa NFATp protein was highly expressed in thymus and spleen.
# T3 Protein S4 38 43 466 471 NFATp
# T4 Protein S4 126 131 554 559 NFATp

Treatment of immunoprecipitated NFATp from untreated HT-2 cells with calcineurin resulted in the dephosphorylation of NFATp, demonstrating that NFATp is an in vitro substrate for calcineurin.
# T5 Protein S5 32 37 643 648 NFATp
# T6 Protein S5 118 123 729 734 NFATp
# T7 Protein S5 144 149 755 760 NFATp

NFATp immunoprecipitated from 32P-labeled HT-2 cells migrated as an approximately 120-kDa protein that was localized to the cytosol of the cells.
# T8 Protein S6 0 5 803 808 NFATp

Treatment of the cells with ionomycin resulted in a decrease in the molecular weight of NFATp and a loss of 32P, consistent with NFATp dephosphorylation.
# T9 Protein S7 88 93 1037 1042 NFATp
# T10 Protein S7 129 134 1078 1083 NFATp

The dephosphorylation of NFATp was accompanied by localization of the protein to the nuclear fraction.
# T11 Protein S8 25 30 1128 1133 NFATp

Both of these events were blocked by preincubation of the cells with FK506, a calcineurin inhibitor, consistent with the hypothesis that NFATp is a calcineurin substrate in cells.
