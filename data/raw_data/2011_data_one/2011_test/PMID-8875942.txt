Signal transduction by DR3, a death domain-containing receptor related to TNFR-1 and CD95.

Tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR-1) and CD95 (also called Fas or APO-1) are cytokine receptors that engage the apoptosis pathway through a region of intracellular homology, designated the "death domain."
# T4 Protein S2 0 32 92 124 Tumor necrosis factor receptor-1
# T5 Protein S2 34 40 126 132 TNFR-1
# T6 Protein S2 46 50 138 142 CD95
# T7 Protein S2 64 67 156 159 Fas
# T8 Protein S2 71 76 163 168 APO-1

Another death domain-containing member of the TNFR family, death receptor 3 (DR3), was identified and was shown to induce both apoptosis and activation of nuclear factor kappaB.

# T10 Protein S3 77 80 379 382 DR3

Expression of DR3 appears to be restricted to tissues enriched in lymphocytes.
# T11 Protein S4 14 17 494 497 DR3

DR3 signal transduction is mediated by a complex of intracellular signaling molecules including TRADD, TRAF2, FADD, and FLICE.
# T12 Protein S5 0 3 559 562 DR3
# T13 Protein S5 96 101 655 660 TRADD
# T14 Protein S5 103 108 662 667 TRAF2
# T15 Protein S5 110 114 669 673 FADD
# T16 Protein S5 120 125 679 684 FLICE

Thus, DR3 likely plays a role in regulating lymphocyte homeostasis.
