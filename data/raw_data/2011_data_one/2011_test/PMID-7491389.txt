Lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor: predictor of sertraline response in adolescent major depressive disorder (MDD).
# T1 Protein S1 11 34 11 34 glucocorticoid receptor

Major depressive disorder (MDD) in adolescents demonstrates resistance to tricyclic antidepressants and absence of hypercortisolemia.

The efficacy of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) is uncertain, and response predictors are unavailable.

Abnormal fast feedback and negative feedback of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis implicates a dampened limbic-hippocampal glucocorticoid type II receptor (GCII).
# T2 Protein S4 129 160 488 519 glucocorticoid type II receptor
# T3 Protein S4 162 166 521 525 GCII

We hypothesized that lymphocyte GCII is altered in adolescent MDD and could serve as a marker for response to SRIs.
# T4 Protein S5 32 36 560 564 GCII

In an open-label study, adolescents (n = 20) meeting DSM-III-R criteria for MDD showed baseline lymphocyte GCII sites per cell (sites/cell) values of 793 +/- 106 versus 2,563 +/- 499 (+/- SEM) for matched controls (n = 18) (t = 3.5; df = 36; p < .001).
# T5 Protein S6 107 111 751 755 GCII

GCII was bimodally distributed, with SRI responders differing from nonresponders (t = 3.9; df = 14; p < .001).
# T6 Protein S7 0 4 897 901 GCII

GCII accurately classified 90 percent of sertraline responders and 80 percent of nonresponders.
# T7 Protein S8 0 4 1008 1012 GCII

Only SRI responders showed GCII sites/cell upregulated after 6 weeks of treatment (t = 2.1, df = 10; p < .05).
# T8 Protein S9 27 31 1131 1135 GCII
