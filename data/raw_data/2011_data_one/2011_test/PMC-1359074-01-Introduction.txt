Introduction

Sry type HMG box (Sox6) is a member of the Sox transcription factor family characterized by the conserved high mobility group (HMG) domain, consisting of 79 amino acids involved in DNA recognition and binding [1].

# T2 Protein S2 18 22 31 35 Sox6

Sox transcription factors bind to the minor groove of DNA and cause a 70degrees-85degrees bend of the DNA that leads to local conformational changes [2,3], while most other transcription factors target the major groove of DNA [4].

Therefore, Sox proteins may perform part of their function as architectural proteins by organizing local chromatin structure and assembling other DNA-bound transcription factors into biologically active, sterically defined multiprotein complexes.

Sox6 has been reported to be able to act as either an activator or a repressor, depending on its interactors and its target promoter context [5,6].

Intriguingly, Sox6 has also been shown to act as a general splicing factor that participates in pre-mRNA splicing [7].
# T4 Protein S6 14 18 867 871 Sox6

Depletion of Sox6 in HeLa cell extracts blocked splicing of multiple substrates, and expression of the HMG domain of either Sox6, Sox9, or Sry in the extracts restored splicing, indicating functional overlap of these proteins [7].
# T5 Protein S7 13 17 985 989 Sox6
# T6 Protein S7 124 128 1096 1100 Sox6
# T7 Protein S7 130 134 1102 1106 Sox9
# T8 Protein S7 139 142 1111 1114 Sry

Regardless of how Sox6 functions in regulating gene expression, previous studies have demonstrated that Sox6 is an important regulatory molecule that plays a role in the development of the central nervous system [8-11], cartilage [6,12,13], and muscle [14,15].
# T9 Protein S8 18 22 1221 1225 Sox6
# T10 Protein S8 104 108 1307 1311 Sox6

A Sox6-null mutant mouse (p100H) has previously been identified in our laboratory [14].
# T11 Protein S9 2 6 1466 1470 Sox6

Mice homozygous for p100H show delayed growth, develop myopathy and arterioventricular heart block, and die within 2 wk after birth [14].

The p100H mutant allele is associated with a Chromosome 7 inversion that disrupts both the p gene and the Sox6 gene (and no other gene within 50,000 nucleotides of the chromosomal breakpoints) [14].
# T12 Protein S11 91 92 1781 1782 p
# T13 Protein S11 106 110 1796 1800 Sox6

Because the p gene functions solely in pigmentation [16], the Sox6 transcription factor is implicated in all other phenotypes.

# T15 Protein S12 62 66 1951 1955 Sox6

Among the HMG box proteins distantly related to Sry (the first member identified of the Sox transcription factor family) that similarly bind to the minor groove and bend DNA, but without sequence specificity, are the ubiquitously expressed HMG1 and HMG2 proteins [17].
# T16 Protein S13 48 51 2065 2068 Sry
# T17 Protein S13 240 244 2257 2261 HMG1
# T18 Protein S13 249 253 2266 2270 HMG2

Modulation of DNA structure by these and other HMG proteins can mediate long-range enhancer function on both DNA and chromatin-assembled genes by bringing together distant regions of DNA and associated factors.

Specifically, HMG proteins have been shown to modulate beta-globin genes [18-21].

The mouse beta-globin genes epsilony, betah1, beta-major, and beta-minor are clustered on Chromosome 7 and they are highly homologous to their human counterparts in organizational structure and function [22].
# T20 Protein S16 28 36 2609 2617 epsilony
# T21 Protein S16 38 44 2619 2625 betah1
# T22 Protein S16 46 56 2627 2637 beta-major
# T23 Protein S16 62 72 2643 2653 beta-minor

High-level expression of these genes requires a regulatory element, the locus control region that is characterized by a set of nuclease hypersensitive sites spread over 25 kb located 5' of the epsilony gene [23].
# T24 Protein S17 25 36 2816 2827 these genes
# T25 Protein S17 193 201 2984 2992 epsilony

The beta-globin genes are expressed in a tissue- and development-specific fashion.

In mice, erythropoiesis originates in the embryonic yolk sac where primitive erythroid cells express epsilony and betah-1 globins [22].
# T26 Protein S19 101 109 3188 3196 epsilony
# T27 Protein S19 114 129 3201 3216 betah-1 globins

At 11.5 d post coitus (dpc), erythropoiesis shifts to the fetal liver where definitive erythroid cells express adult beta globins (beta major and minor) [22].
# T28 Protein S20 117 129 3340 3352 beta globins
# T29 Protein S20 131 141 3354 3364 beta major
# T30 Protein S20 146 151 3369 3374 minor

The epsilony gene is silenced in definitive erythroid cells.
# T31 Protein S21 4 12 3386 3394 epsilony

The mechanism of silencing of its human counterpart, epsilon globin, has been studied extensively.
# T32 Protein S22 53 67 3496 3510 epsilon globin

In definitive erythropoiesis, epsilon is activated and silenced autonomously [24,25], although in primitive erythropoiesis epsilon also appears to be regulated competitively [26].
# T33 Protein S23 30 37 3572 3579 epsilon
# T34 Protein S23 123 130 3665 3672 epsilon

The gamma-globin to adult beta-globin switch is controlled by promoter competition for the LCR [24,25].
# T35 Protein S24 4 16 3726 3738 gamma-globin
# T36 Protein S24 26 37 3748 3759 beta-globin

All the elements responsible for silencing the epsilon globin gene are within the epsilon gene or in adjacent sequences [27], suggesting that silencing is primarily gene autonomous.
# T37 Protein S25 47 61 3874 3888 epsilon globin
# T38 Protein S25 82 89 3909 3916 epsilon

Using promoter deletion analyses in transgenic mouse models and cell transfection assays, multiple DNA elements important to the silencing process have been previously identified in both the proximal and the distal epsilon gene promoter [27].
# T39 Protein S26 215 222 4224 4231 epsilon

Their corresponding transcription factors, such as GATA-1, YY-1, COUP-TF, and DRED have been identified and shown to directly bind to these DNA elements (as part of protein complexes) to regulate epsilon silencing [27].
# T40 Protein S27 51 57 4303 4309 GATA-1
# T41 Protein S27 59 63 4311 4315 YY-1
# T42 Protein S27 65 72 4317 4324 COUP-TF
# T43 Protein S27 78 82 4330 4334 DRED
# T44 Protein S27 196 203 4448 4455 epsilon

Thus, it appears that the silencing of the epsilon gene involves a complicated network of multiple cis elements and transacting proteins.
# T45 Protein S28 43 50 4515 4522 epsilon

In addition to playing an important role in the development of the central nervous system [8-11], cartilage [6,12,13], and muscle [14,15], it was shown that Sox6 is upregulated in long-term hematopoiesis stem cells (LT-HSC) compared with multipotent progenitors of adult mouse bone marrow lineage [28].
# T46 Protein S29 157 161 4768 4772 Sox6

In this study, we describe that Sox6 also exerts pleiotropic effects on erythropoiesis.
# T47 Protein S30 32 36 4946 4950 Sox6

These effects include delayed maturation of erythrocytes (that normally enucleate prior to entering the bloodstream [27]) and higher expression of embryonic globin genes.

The most extreme effect is the persistence of high expression of the embryonic epsilony globin gene.
# T48 Protein S32 79 94 5252 5267 epsilony globin

Here we describe and characterize the effects of Sox6 on the epsilony globin gene.
# T49 Protein S33 49 53 5323 5327 Sox6
# T50 Protein S33 61 76 5335 5350 epsilony globin

We show that Sox6 binds to the proximal promoter of epsilony globin and represses its transcription.
# T51 Protein S34 13 17 5370 5374 Sox6
# T52 Protein S34 52 67 5409 5424 epsilony globin
# T53 Protein S34 82 85 5439 5442 its

In wild-type (WT) mice, Sox6 is not expressed in yolk sac blood islands, but is expressed in fetal liver, the opposite expression pattern of epsilony globin.
# T54 Protein S35 24 28 5482 5486 Sox6
# T55 Protein S35 141 156 5599 5614 epsilony globin

In the absence of Sox6, epsilony globin is ectopically expressed in the fetal liver, demonstrating that Sox6 functions in definitive erythropoiesis.

# T57 Protein S36 24 39 5640 5655 epsilony globin
