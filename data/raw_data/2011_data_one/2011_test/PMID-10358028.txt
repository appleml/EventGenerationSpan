20-Epi analogues of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 are highly potent inducers of DRIP coactivator complex binding to the vitamin D3 receptor.

1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) plays a major role in the stimulation of bone growth, mineralization, and intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption; it also acts as a general inhibitor of cellular proliferation.

Several new, clinically relevant compounds dissociate antiproliferative and calcemic activities of 1,25(OH)2D3, but the molecular basis for this has not been clearly elucidated.

Here, we tested whether the potency of one class of compounds, 20-epi analogues, to induce myeloid cell differentiation, is because of direct molecular effects on vitamin D receptor (VDR).

We report that two 20-epi analogues, MC1627 and MC1288, induced differentiation and transcription of p21(Waf1,Cip1), a key VDR target gene involved in growth inhibition, at a concentration 100-fold lower than that of 1,25(OH)2D3.

# T5 Protein S5 105 109 830 834 Waf1
# T6 Protein S5 110 114 835 839 Cip1
# T7 Protein S5 123 126 848 851 VDR

We compared this sensitivity to analogue effects on VDR interacting proteins: RXR, GRIP-1, and DRIP205, a subunit of the DRIP coactivator complex.

# T9 Protein S6 83 89 1038 1044 GRIP-1
# T10 Protein S6 95 102 1050 1057 DRIP205

Compared with the interaction of VDR with RXR or GRIP-1, the differentiation dose-response most closely correlated to the ligand-dependent recruitment of the DRIP coactivator complex to VDR and to the ability of the receptor to activate transcription in a cell-free system.
# T11 Protein S7 33 36 1135 1138 VDR
# T12 Protein S7 49 55 1151 1157 GRIP-1
# T13 Protein S7 186 189 1288 1291 VDR

These results provide compelling links between the efficiency of the 20-epi analogue in inducing VDR/DRIP interactions, transactivation in vitro, and its enhanced ability to induce cellular differentiation.
