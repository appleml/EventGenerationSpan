A central role for a single c-Myb binding site in a thymic locus control region.

Locus control regions (LCRs) are powerful assemblies of cis elements that organize the actions of cell-type-specific trans-acting factors.

A 2.3-kb LCR in the human adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene first intron, which controls expression in thymocytes, is composed of a 200-bp enhancer domain and extended flanking sequences that facilitate activation from within chromatin.

# T3 Protein S3 47 50 268 271 ADA

Prior analyses have demonstrated that the enhancer contains a 28-bp core region and local adjacent augmentative cis elements.

We now show that the core contains a single critical c-Myb binding site.

In both transiently cotransfected human cells and stable chromatin-integrated yeast cells, c-Myb strongly transactivated reporter constructs that contained polymerized core sequences.

c-Myb protein was strongly evident in T lymphoblasts in which the enhancer was active and was localized within discrete nuclear structures.
# T6 Protein S7 0 5 838 843 c-Myb

Fetal murine thymus exhibited a striking concordance of endogenous c-myb expression with that of mouse ADA and human ADA LCR-directed transgene expression.

# T8 Protein S8 103 106 1081 1084 ADA
# T9 Protein S8 117 120 1095 1098 ADA

Point mutation of the c-Myb site within the intact 2.3-kb LCR severely attenuated enhancer activity in transfections and LCR activity in transgenic thymocytes.

Within the context of a complex enhancer and LCR, c-Myb can act as an organizer of thymocyte-specific gene expression via a single binding site.
