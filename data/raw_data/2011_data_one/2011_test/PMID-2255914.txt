Disruption of the human SCL locus by "illegitimate" V-(D)-J recombinase activity.
# T1 Protein S1 24 27 24 27 SCL

A fusion complementary DNA in the T cell line HSB-2 elucidates a provocative mechanism for the disruption of the putative hematopoietic transcription factor SCL.
# T2 Protein S2 157 160 240 243 SCL

The fusion cDNA results from an interstitial deletion between a previously unknown locus, SIL (SCL interrupting locus), and the 5' untranslated region of SCL.
# T3 Protein S3 95 98 340 343 SCL
# T4 Protein S3 154 157 399 402 SCL

Similar to 1;14 translocations, this deletion disrupts the SCL 5' regulatory region.
# T5 Protein S4 59 62 463 466 SCL

This event is probably mediated by V-(D)-J recombinase activity, although neither locus is an immunoglobulin or a T cell receptor.

Two other T cell lines, CEM and RPMI 8402, have essentially identical deletions.

Thus, in lymphocytes, growth-affecting genes other than immune receptors risk rearrangements.
