The functional synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 involves p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and is associated with the augmentation of STAT serine phosphorylation.
# T1 Protein S1 41 45 41 45 IL-2

IL-12 and IL-2 can stimulate mitogen- or CD3-activated T cells to proliferate, produce IFN-gamma, and kill tumor cells.
# T2 Protein S2 10 14 175 179 IL-2
# T3 Protein S2 87 96 252 261 IFN-gamma

The magnitude of these functional responses is greatly augmented when T cells are activated by the combination of IL-12 and IL-2.
# T4 Protein S3 124 128 409 413 IL-2

Although peripheral blood T cells are largely unresponsive to these cytokines without prior activation, a small subset of CD8+ T cells (CD8+CD18bright) is strongly activated by the combination of IL-12 and IL-2.
# T5 Protein S4 122 125 537 540 CD8
# T6 Protein S4 136 139 551 554 CD8
# T7 Protein S4 206 210 621 625 IL-2

In this report we show that the functional synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 in CD8+CD18bright T cells correlates with the activation of the stress kinases, p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/Jun N-terminal kinase, but not with the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases.
# T8 Protein S5 69 73 696 700 IL-2
# T9 Protein S5 77 80 704 707 CD8

The functional synergy between IL-2 and IL-12 is also associated with a prominent increase in STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation over that observed with IL-12 or IL-2 alone.
# T10 Protein S6 31 35 996 1000 IL-2
# T11 Protein S6 94 99 1059 1064 STAT1
# T12 Protein S6 104 109 1069 1074 STAT3
# T13 Protein S6 166 170 1131 1135 IL-2

By contrast, STAT tyrosine phosphorylation is not augmented over that seen with either cytokine alone.

A specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase completely inhibits the serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 induced by IL-12 and IL-2 and abrogates the functional synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 without affecting STAT tyrosine phosphorylation.
# T14 Protein S8 89 94 1335 1340 STAT1
# T15 Protein S8 99 104 1345 1350 STAT3
# T16 Protein S8 126 130 1372 1376 IL-2
# T17 Protein S8 186 190 1432 1436 IL-2

This suggests that p38 MAP kinase may play an important role in regulating STAT serine phosphorylation in response to the combination of IL-12 and IL-2.
# T18 Protein S9 147 151 1633 1637 IL-2

Furthermore, these findings indicate that the optimal activation of T cells by IL-12 and IL-2 may depend on an interaction between the p38 MAP kinase and Janus kinase/STAT signaling pathways.
# T19 Protein S10 89 93 1728 1732 IL-2
