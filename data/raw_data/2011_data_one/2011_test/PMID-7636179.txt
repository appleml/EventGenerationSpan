Latent membrane protein-1 induces cyclin D2 expression, pRb hyperphosphorylation, and loss of TGF-beta 1-mediated growth inhibition in EBV-positive B cells.

The normal cell cycle is regulated by several molecules, such as the tumor-suppressor protein pRb, the G1 cyclins, the cyclin-dependent kinases, and their inhibitors.
# T5 Protein S2 94 97 252 255 pRb

These regulators are targeted by negative growth regulatory signals, such as that provided by TGF-beta.

Here, we show that the presence of either wild-type EBV or its transforming latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) results in the loss of TGF-beta 1-mediated growth inhibition in human B cells.

# T7 Protein S4 103 108 532 537 LMP-1
# T8 Protein S4 133 143 562 572 TGF-beta 1

Chemical cross-linking with 125I-labeled TGF-beta 1 showed an essentially normal TGF-beta receptor profile in EBV-positive and EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, and these receptors were shown to be functional in transducing signals, as evidenced by the TGF-beta 1-mediated modulation of junB gene expression.

# T10 Protein S5 263 273 881 891 TGF-beta 1
# T11 Protein S5 297 301 915 919 junB

However, TGF-beta 1 did not induce dephosphorylation of pRb in EBV (or LMP-1)-positive cells as opposed to EBV-negative cells, suggesting a dichotomy in the TGF-beta 1 signaling pathway leading to separable gene regulatory and growth inhibitory responses.
# T12 Protein S6 9 19 946 956 TGF-beta 1
# T13 Protein S6 56 59 993 996 pRb
# T14 Protein S6 71 76 1008 1013 LMP-1
# T15 Protein S6 157 167 1094 1104 TGF-beta 1

Furthermore, LMP-1 was found to induce the expression of cyclin D2; normal B cells or EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cells do not express D-type cyclins.
# T16 Protein S7 13 18 1206 1211 LMP-1
# T17 Protein S7 57 66 1250 1259 cyclin D2

Taken together, these data point to a potential mechanism underlying EBV-mediated B cell transformation whereby constitutive induction of key cell cycle regulators by LMP-1 can lead to pRb hyperphosphorylation and uncontrolled cell proliferation.
