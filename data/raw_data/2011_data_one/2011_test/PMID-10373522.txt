p70(s6k) integrates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and rapamycin-regulated signals for E2F regulation in T lymphocytes.
# T1 Protein S1 0 8 0 8 p70(s6k)

In T lymphocytes, the hematopoietic cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) uses phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)-induced signaling pathways to regulate E2F transcriptional activity, a critical cell cycle checkpoint.
# T2 Protein S2 45 58 165 178 interleukin-2
# T3 Protein S2 60 64 180 184 IL-2

PI 3-kinase also regulates the activity of p70(s6k), the 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase, a response that is abrogated by the macrolide rapamycin.
# T4 Protein S3 43 51 381 389 p70(s6k)

This immunosuppressive drug is known to prevent T-cell proliferation, but the precise point at which rapamycin regulates T-cell cycle progression has yet to be elucidated.

Moreover, the effects of rapamycin on, and the role of p70(s6k) in, IL-2 and PI 3-kinase activation of E2Fs have not been characterized.
# T5 Protein S5 55 63 712 720 p70(s6k)
# T6 Protein S5 68 72 725 729 IL-2

Our present results show that IL-2- and PI 3-kinase-induced pathways for the regulation of E2F transcriptional activity include both rapamycin-resistant and rapamycin-sensitive components.
# T7 Protein S6 30 34 824 828 IL-2

Expression of a rapamycin-resistant mutant of p70(s6k) in T cells could restore rapamycin-suppressed E2F responses.
# T8 Protein S7 46 54 1029 1037 p70(s6k)

Thus, the rapamycin-controlled processes involved in E2F regulation appear to be mediated by p70(s6k).
# T9 Protein S8 93 101 1192 1200 p70(s6k)

However, the rapamycin-resistant p70(s6k) could not rescue rapamycin inhibition of T-cell cycle entry, consistent with the involvement of additional, rapamycin-sensitive pathways in the control of T-cell cycle progression.
# T10 Protein S9 33 41 1235 1243 p70(s6k)

The present results thus show that p70(s6k) is able to regulate E2F transcriptional activity and provide direct evidence for the first time for a link between IL-2 receptors, PI 3-kinase, and p70(s6k) that regulates a crucial G1 checkpoint in T lymphocytes.
# T11 Protein S10 35 43 1460 1468 p70(s6k)
# T12 Protein S10 159 163 1584 1588 IL-2
# T13 Protein S10 192 200 1617 1625 p70(s6k)
