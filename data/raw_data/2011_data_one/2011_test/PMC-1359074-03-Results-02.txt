Transfection Studies Using GM979 Cells Indicate That Sox6 Directly Represses the epsilony Gene Promoter at the Transcriptional Level
# T1 Protein S1 53 57 53 57 Sox6
# T2 Protein S1 81 89 81 89 epsilony

Real-time PCR assays (Figure 1) measure steady-state levels of epsilony mRNA, not transcriptional activity of the epsilony promoter.
# T3 Protein S2 63 71 196 204 epsilony
# T4 Protein S2 114 122 247 255 epsilony

To investigate whether Sox6 directly acts on the epsilony gene promoter at the transcriptional level, we used an in vitro transient transfection assay and GM979 cells, a murine erythroleukemic cell line that expresses both epsilony and adult beta globins [30].
# T5 Protein S3 23 27 289 293 Sox6
# T6 Protein S3 49 57 315 323 epsilony
# T7 Protein S3 223 231 489 497 epsilony
# T8 Protein S3 242 254 508 520 beta globins

We generated an epsilony promoter reporter construct (E-Luc) by fusing a micro-LCR (muLCR) element (2.5 kb) [31] to the epsilony proximal promoter (2.2 kb), followed by the luciferase reporter gene, as shown in Figure 2A (detailed in Materials and Methods).
# T9 Protein S4 16 24 543 551 epsilony
# T10 Protein S4 120 128 647 655 epsilony
# T11 Protein S4 173 183 700 710 luciferase

Overexpression of Sox6 in GM979 cells by transient transfection leads to a dosage-dependent repression of E-Luc reporter activity (Figure 2B).
# T12 Protein S5 18 22 803 807 Sox6

In contrast, overexpression of a truncated Sox6 protein that lacks its HMG domain [32] (similar to the p100H mouse allele) fails to repress E-Luc activity (Figure 2B).
# T13 Protein S6 43 47 971 975 Sox6

These data indicate that Sox6 acts to repress the epsilony promoter at the transcriptional level.
# T14 Protein S7 25 29 1121 1125 Sox6
# T15 Protein S7 50 58 1146 1154 epsilony

Sox6 has been shown to act as a repressor and to interact with a widely expressed co-repressor, CtBP2, on the fgf-3 promoter [5].
# T16 Protein S8 0 4 1195 1199 Sox6
# T17 Protein S8 96 101 1291 1296 CtBP2
# T18 Protein S8 110 115 1305 1310 fgf-3

CtBP2 is expressed in GM979 cells (unpublished data).
# T19 Protein S9 0 5 1325 1330 CtBP2

To investigate whether the interaction with CtBP2 is required for Sox6 repression of the epsilony promoter, we introduced a point mutation (L386H) in the Sox6 protein that has been previously reported to be sufficient to abolish Sox6-CtBP2 interaction [5].
# T20 Protein S10 44 49 1423 1428 CtBP2
# T21 Protein S10 66 70 1445 1449 Sox6
# T22 Protein S10 89 97 1468 1476 epsilony
# T23 Protein S10 154 158 1533 1537 Sox6
# T24 Protein S10 229 233 1608 1612 Sox6
# T25 Protein S10 234 239 1613 1618 CtBP2

This amino acid change is not in the HMG DNA binding domain.

However, this mutant version of Sox6 retains the ability to repress the epsilony promoter in the transfection assay (Figure 2B), indicating that Sox6 represses the epsilony promoter in a CtBP2-independent manner.
# T26 Protein S12 32 36 1729 1733 Sox6
# T27 Protein S12 72 80 1769 1777 epsilony
# T28 Protein S12 145 149 1842 1846 Sox6
# T29 Protein S12 164 172 1861 1869 epsilony
# T30 Protein S12 187 192 1884 1889 CtBP2

Deletion analysis of the epsilony promoter, as shown in Figure 2C, defined a region (-63 to -37) within the epsilony proximal promoter that is critical for Sox6 repression.
# T31 Protein S13 25 33 1935 1943 epsilony
# T32 Protein S13 108 116 2018 2026 epsilony
# T33 Protein S13 156 160 2066 2070 Sox6

Analysis of this short region reveals two Sox/Sox6 consensus binding sites [5] (Figure 3A).
