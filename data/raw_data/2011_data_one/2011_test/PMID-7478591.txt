The murine BCL6 gene is induced in activated lymphocytes as an immediate early gene.

The chromosomal translocation involving 3q27 is often detected in human B-cell lymphomas, especially diffuse lymphomas with a large-cell component.

The BCL6 gene has been isolated from the chromosomal breakpoint in these lymphomas.
# T2 Protein S3 4 8 238 242 BCL6

Here we cloned the murine BCL6 (mBCL6) cDNA from the muscle cDNA library using the human BCL6 (hBCL6) cDNA as a probe.
# T3 Protein S4 26 30 344 348 BCL6
# T4 Protein S4 32 37 350 355 mBCL6
# T5 Protein S4 89 93 407 411 BCL6
# T6 Protein S4 95 100 413 418 hBCL6

The predicted amino acid sequence was 95% identical to that of hBCL6.
# T7 Protein S5 63 68 500 505 hBCL6

It contains six repeats of the Kruppel-like zinc-finger motif that are completely identical to those of hBCL6, indicating that the BCL6 gene is well conserved between humans and mice.
# T8 Protein S6 104 109 611 616 hBCL6
# T9 Protein S6 131 135 638 642 BCL6

Expression of the mBCL6 gene was ubiquitously detected in adult mouse tissues including lymphatic organs.
# T10 Protein S7 18 23 709 714 mBCL6

Furthermore, it was induced in lymphocytes activated with phorbol ester and Ca2+ ionophore within 30 min after stimulation.

This induction was not inhibited by treatment of the cells with a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide.

These results suggest that BCL6 plays a role in activated lymphocytes as an immediate early gene.
