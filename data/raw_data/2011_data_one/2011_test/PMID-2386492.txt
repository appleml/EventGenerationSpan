Detection in non-erythroid cells of a factor with the binding characteristics of the erythroid cell transcription factor EF1.
# T1 Protein S1 121 124 121 124 EF1

The erythroid transcription factor erythroid factor-1 (EF1) plays a critical role in the transcription of erythroid-specific genes.
# T2 Protein S2 35 53 162 180 erythroid factor-1
# T3 Protein S2 55 58 182 185 EF1

Here we report the presence of a factor with the mobility and sequence-specific DNA-binding characteristics of EF1 at low abundance in a wide variety of non-erythroid cell types.
# T4 Protein S3 111 114 370 373 EF1

This is the first report of an EF1-like activity in non-erythroid cells and indicates that this factor may play a role in the regulation of genes expressed in such cells.
