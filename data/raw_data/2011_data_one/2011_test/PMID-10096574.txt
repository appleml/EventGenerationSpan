Glucocorticoid-induced cell death requires autoinduction of glucocorticoid receptor expression in human leukemic T cells.
# T1 Protein S1 60 83 60 83 glucocorticoid receptor

In contrast to the negative autoregulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression seen in most cells and tissues, GR expression is positively autoregulated in human leukemic T cells and in other cells sensitive to glucocorticoid-induced cell death.
# T2 Protein S2 46 69 169 192 glucocorticoid receptor
# T3 Protein S2 71 73 194 196 GR
# T4 Protein S2 118 120 241 243 GR

To determine whether positive autoregulation is a necessary component of glucocorticoid-induced cell death, a wild-type GR gene under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter was stably transfected into glucocorticoid-resistant cells lacking endogenous functional receptor.

Transfectants grown in the presence of tetracycline contained about 15,000 receptors/cell, a value approximately equal to basal level GR expression in glucocorticoid-sensitive 6TG1.1 cells before steroid treatment.
# T6 Protein S4 134 136 792 794 GR

Under these conditions, dexamethasone had a minimal effect on cell growth, elicited little internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and induced no cell cycle perturbation.

In the absence of tetracycline, GR mRNA and protein expression increased 2-3-fold, and cells expressed 48,000 receptors, a level nearly equivalent to that present in 6TG1.1 cells after 18 h of autoinduction.
# T7 Protein S6 32 34 1072 1074 GR

Under these conditions, dexamethasone markedly inhibited cell growth, caused G1 arrest, and induced significant internucleosomal DNA fragmentation.

These studies therefore suggest that basal level GR expression is inadequate to mediate glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in glucocorticoid-sensitive T cells and that positive autoregulation is a necessary component of this process.
