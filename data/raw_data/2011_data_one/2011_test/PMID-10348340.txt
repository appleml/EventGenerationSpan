Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax protein induces the expression of STAT1 and STAT5 genes in T-cells.
# T1 Protein S1 35 38 35 38 Tax
# T2 Protein S1 73 78 73 78 STAT1
# T3 Protein S1 83 88 83 88 STAT5

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax transforms normal T-cells in the presence of interleukin (IL)-2 in vitro.
# T4 Protein S2 44 47 152 155 Tax
# T5 Protein S2 93 111 201 219 interleukin (IL)-2

STAT is a family of transcription factors that play a pivotal role in cytokine-induced functions of a various type of cells.

We investigated the involvement of STATs in the transformation of T-cells by HTLV-1.

HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines expressed higher amounts of STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 RNA and proteins than virus-negative T cells.
# T6 Protein S5 60 65 500 505 STAT1
# T7 Protein S5 67 72 507 512 STAT3
# T8 Protein S5 77 82 517 522 STAT5

The expression of STAT1 and STAT5 in a human T-cell line was induced by Tax.
# T9 Protein S6 18 23 587 592 STAT1
# T10 Protein S6 28 33 597 602 STAT5
# T11 Protein S6 72 75 641 644 Tax

IL-2 induced the DNA binding activity of STAT3 and STAT5 of a HTLV-1-transformed cell line and then stimulated its proliferation.
# T12 Protein S7 0 4 646 650 IL-2
# T13 Protein S7 41 46 687 692 STAT3
# T14 Protein S7 51 56 697 702 STAT5

In contrast, IL-2 did neither in a cell line lacking STAT3 and STAT5.
# T15 Protein S8 13 17 789 793 IL-2
# T16 Protein S8 53 58 829 834 STAT3
# T17 Protein S8 63 68 839 844 STAT5

The expression of STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 mRNAs were also induced by a T-cell mitogen in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
# T18 Protein S9 18 23 864 869 STAT1
# T19 Protein S9 25 30 871 876 STAT3
# T20 Protein S9 35 40 881 886 STAT5

Our results suggest that the induction of STAT1 and STAT5 by Tax enhances cytokine-induced functions of virus-infected T-cells, hence the induction may play a role in IL-2-dependent transformation steps of T-cells by HTLV-1.
# T21 Protein S10 42 47 1025 1030 STAT1
# T22 Protein S10 52 57 1035 1040 STAT5
