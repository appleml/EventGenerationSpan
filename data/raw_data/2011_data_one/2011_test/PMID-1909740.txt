Role of transcriptional regulation by DNA sequence motifs and mRNA stabilization.

The cytokine TNF mediates many of the pathologic signs of cachexia, inflammation, and sepsis.
# T2 Protein S3 13 16 178 181 TNF

The current work describes the regulation of TNF in human myelomonocytic cell lines after PMA stimulation.
# T3 Protein S4 45 48 304 307 TNF

The cell lines exhibit a low level of constitutive TNF mRNA expression.
# T4 Protein S5 51 54 417 420 TNF

Within 2 to 4 h of PMA exposure, steady state levels of TNF mRNA are markedly elevated in all myelomonocytic cell lines studied.
# T5 Protein S6 56 59 494 497 TNF

This rise is due to increased mRNA stability, which increased by almost twofold, and to an overall increase in transcription, which rises by more than sixfold.

At the level of the genomic TNF gene, a DNase I hypersensitive site is detected within the TNF promoter between -200 to -100 bp relative to the transcription initiation site.

# T7 Protein S8 91 94 818 821 TNF

Although absent in nonexpressing erythroleukemia cell lines, the DNase I site is present in uninduced myelomonocytic cell lines and is not changed after PMA induction.

The PMA induction of c-fos mRNA correlated well with TNF gene induction; expression of genes encoding other proteins in the AP-1 complex (junB and junD) were also induced by PMA.

# T9 Protein S10 53 56 1123 1126 TNF
# T10 Protein S10 138 142 1208 1212 junB
# T11 Protein S10 147 151 1217 1221 junD

The nuclear extracts from resting and induced ML-1 cells contain proteins binding specifically to the AP-1, AP-2, and NF kappa B sequence located within the TNF promoter.
# T12 Protein S11 157 160 1406 1409 TNF

PMA induction increases the level of a number of specific binding complexes relative to the resting cells.

The regulatory mechanisms of the human and murine TNF genes are discussed.
