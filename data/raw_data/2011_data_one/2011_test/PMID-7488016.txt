Expression of the chemokine receptor BLR2/EBI1 is specifically transactivated by Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2.

# T2 Protein S1 42 46 42 46 EBI1
# T3 Protein S1 81 117 81 117 Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2

In our attempt to identify chemokine receptors that are related to Burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1 (BLR1) and are expressed in activated lymphocytes we used RT-PCR resulting in the isolation of a cDNA encoding a seven transmembrane receptor termed BLR2.
# T4 Protein S2 67 96 187 216 Burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1
# T5 Protein S2 98 102 218 222 BLR1
# T6 Protein S2 246 250 366 370 BLR2

The protein shows significant sequence similarities to the family of G-protein coupled chemokine receptors and turned out to be identical to the recently described receptor EBI1.
# T7 Protein S3 173 177 545 549 EBI1

Northern blot analysis revealed that BLR2 mRNA could be highly stimulated in mitogen- and anti-CD3-treated peripheral blood lymphocytes.
# T8 Protein S4 37 41 588 592 BLR2

BLR2-specific mRNA could be detected in all Epstein-Barr virus positive B cell lines.
# T9 Protein S5 0 4 688 692 BLR2

We show that transcription of the BLR2 gene could be specifically induced in Epstein-Barr virus negative BL 41 cells via estrogen-mediated activation of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2, a key regulator of viral and cellular genes in immortalized B cells.
# T10 Protein S6 34 38 808 812 BLR2
# T11 Protein S6 153 189 927 963 Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2

Our data suggest an involvement of BLR2 in the regulation of migration in activated lymphocytes and in viral pathogenesis.
# T12 Protein S7 35 39 1069 1073 BLR2
