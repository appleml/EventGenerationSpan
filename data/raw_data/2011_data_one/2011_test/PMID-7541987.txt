The Ah receptor recognizes DNA binding sites for the B cell transcription factor, BSAP: a possible mechanism for dioxin-mediated alteration of CD19 gene expression in human B lymphocytes.

2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) inhibits murine and human B lymphocyte immunoglobulin production through an unknown mechanism.

This study investigated the effect of TCDD on expression of the CD19 gene in a human B lymphocyte cell line.
# T5 Protein S3 64 68 391 395 CD19

Northern blot analysis showed that TCDD treatment decreased steady state levels of CD19 mRNA by 67% in the IM-9 cell line.
# T6 Protein S4 83 87 519 523 CD19

Using a gel mobility shift assay, we identified a DNA-binding complex in IM-9 nuclear extracts that by several criteria appears to be the Ah receptor.
# T7 Protein S5 138 149 697 708 Ah receptor

In addition, the Ah receptor complex recognized a DNA binding site for B cell lineage-specific activator protein (BSAP) in the promoter region of the human CD19 gene which is similar to the consensus Ah receptor DNA binding site.
# T8 Protein S6 17 28 727 738 Ah receptor
# T9 Protein S6 71 112 781 822 B cell lineage-specific activator protein
# T10 Protein S6 114 118 824 828 BSAP
# T11 Protein S6 156 160 866 870 CD19
# T12 Protein S6 200 211 910 921 Ah receptor

These results suggest that the AhR could interfere with BSAP-stimulated CD19 gene transcription by competition for a common DNA binding site.
