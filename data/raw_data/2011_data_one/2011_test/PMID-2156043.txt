Constitutive expression of HIV-1 tat protein in human Jurkat T cells using a BK virus vector.
# T1 Protein S1 33 36 33 36 tat

The production and characterization of Jurkat cell lines that constitutively express functional human immune deficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) tat protein, using a BK virus plasmid expression vector and HIV-1 tat cDNA, is described.
# T2 Protein S2 141 144 236 239 tat
# T3 Protein S2 207 210 302 305 tat

An increased growth rate of these Jurkat-tat cell lines as compared with control cell lines was observed.
# T4 Protein S3 41 44 367 370 tat
