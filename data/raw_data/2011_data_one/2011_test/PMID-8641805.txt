Effects of interleukin-10 on human peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses to Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, and lipopolysaccharide.
# T1 Protein S1 11 25 11 25 interleukin-10

Deactivation of mononuclear phagocytes is critical to limit the inflammatory response but can be detrimental in the face of progressive infection.

We compared the effects of the deactivating cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) on human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Cryptococcus neoformans, and Candida albicans.
# T2 Protein S3 53 67 350 364 interleukin 10
# T3 Protein S3 69 74 366 371 IL-10

IL-10 effected dose-dependent inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) release in PBMC stimulated by LPS and C. neoformans, with significant inhibition seen with 0.1 U/ml and greater than 90% inhibition noted with 10 U/ml.
# T4 Protein S4 0 5 509 514 IL-10
# T5 Protein S4 44 71 553 580 tumor necrosis factor alpha
# T6 Protein S4 73 82 582 591 TNF-alpha

In contrast, even at doses as high as 100 U/ml, IL-10 inhibited TNF-alpha release in response to C. albicans by only 50%.
# T7 Protein S5 48 53 793 798 IL-10
# T8 Protein S5 64 73 809 818 TNF-alpha

IL-10 profoundly inhibited release of IL-1beta from PBMC stimulated by all three stimuli.
# T9 Protein S6 0 5 867 872 IL-10
# T10 Protein S6 38 46 905 913 IL-1beta

TNF-alpha mRNA and release was inhibited even if IL-10 was added up to 8 h after cryptococcal stimulation.
# T11 Protein S7 0 9 957 966 TNF-alpha
# T12 Protein S7 49 54 1006 1011 IL-10

In contrast, inhibition of IL-1 beta mRNA was of lesser magnitude and occurred only when IL-10 was added within 2 h of cryptococcal stimulation.
# T13 Protein S8 27 36 1091 1100 IL-1 beta
# T14 Protein S8 89 94 1153 1158 IL-10

IL-10 inhibited translocation of NF-kappaB in response to LPS but not the fungal stimuli.
# T15 Protein S9 0 5 1209 1214 IL-10

All three stimuli induced IL-10 production in PBMC, although over 10-fold less IL-10 was released in response to C. neoformans compared with LPS and C. albicans.
# T16 Protein S10 26 31 1325 1330 IL-10
# T17 Protein S10 79 84 1378 1383 IL-10

Thus, while IL-10 has deactivating effects on PBMC responses to all three stimuli, disparate stimulus- and response-specific patterns of deactivation are seen.
# T18 Protein S11 12 17 1473 1478 IL-10

Inhibition by IL-10 of proinflammatory cytokine release appears to occur at the level of gene transcription for TNF-alpha and both transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally for IL-1beta.
# T19 Protein S12 14 19 1635 1640 IL-10
# T20 Protein S12 112 121 1733 1742 TNF-alpha
# T21 Protein S12 179 187 1800 1808 IL-1beta
