1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor RNA: expression in hematopoietic cells.
# T1 Protein S1 0 33 0 33 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor

1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] induces differentiation and inhibits proliferation of myeloid leukemic cells from various lines and patients; these effects are probably mediated through the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor.
# T2 Protein S2 197 217 272 292 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor

Little is known of expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA in hematopoietic cells.
# T3 Protein S3 33 53 327 347 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor

We examined the expression and modulation of expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA in various proliferating and nonproliferating hematopoietic cells.
# T4 Protein S4 59 79 435 455 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor

Constitutive expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA was detected in various kinds of hematopoietic cells, including macrophages and activated T lymphocytes, as well as in cell lines KG-1 (myeloblasts), HL-60 (promyelocytes), ML-3 (myelomonoblasts), U937, THP-1 (monoblasts), K562 (erythroblasts), and S-LB1 (HTLV-1-transfected T lymphocytes).
# T5 Protein S5 27 47 554 574 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor

Receptor transcripts were 4.6 kilobases (kb), and no variant sizes were observed.

All cell lines examined in this group also expressed 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors.
# T6 Protein S7 53 74 1005 1026 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors

Most B lymphocyte lines expressed negligible levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA and protein; however; analysis of a lymphoid/myeloid somatic hybrid suggested that suppression of expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA in B lymphocytes may be a dominant characteristic.
# T7 Protein S8 55 75 1083 1103 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor
# T8 Protein S8 192 212 1220 1240 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor

HL-60 cells were cultured with 10(-7) mol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 for 24 to 72 hours, and levels of expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor and its RNA were examined.
# T9 Protein S9 104 124 1400 1420 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor

Levels of RNA coding for the receptor were not modulated by exposure to high levels of ligand.

Levels of occupied 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor protein increased in these HL-60 cells; but the total number of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors decreased about 50% at 24 hours and returned toward normal at 72 hours.
# T10 Protein S11 19 39 1562 1582 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor
# T11 Protein S11 104 125 1647 1668 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors

Steady-state levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA were not affected by terminal differentiation of HL-60 toward either granulocytes or macrophages.
# T12 Protein S12 23 43 1764 1784 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor

Nondividing macrophages from normal individuals also expressed 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA.
# T13 Protein S13 63 83 1950 1970 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor

In contrast, nondividing peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal individuals did not express 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA; with stimulation of proliferation of these cells, accumulation of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA increased markedly.
# T14 Protein S14 94 114 2070 2090 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor
# T15 Protein S14 186 206 2162 2182 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor

Half-life (t1/2) of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA in T lymphocytes was short (1 hour) as determined by measuring decay of the message after addition of actinomycin D. Consistent with this short t1/2, accumulation of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA increased in cells as their protein synthesis was inhibited.
# T16 Protein S15 20 40 2227 2247 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor
# T17 Protein S15 211 231 2418 2438 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor

Further studies are required to understand the physiologic role of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors in myeloid cells and proliferating T lymphocytes.
# T18 Protein S16 67 88 2571 2592 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors
