Cleavage of transcription factor SP1 by caspases during anti-IgM-induced B-cell apoptosis.
# T1 Protein S1 33 36 33 36 SP1

Apoptosis is instrumental in the processes generating the diversity of the B-cell repertoire.

Autoreactive B-cells are eliminated by anti-IgM crosslinking after encountering self-antigens, but precise mechanisms leading to B-cell apoptosis are still not well understood.

We report here the cleavage of the transcription factor SP1 in the human Burkitt lymphoma cell line BL60 during anti-IgM-induced apoptosis.
# T2 Protein S4 56 59 419 422 SP1

Western blot analysis revealed two cleavage products of approximately 68 kDa and 45 kDa after induction of apoptosis.

Cleavage could be completely inhibited by zDEVD-fmk, an inhibitor specific for caspase 3-like proteases.

In-vitro cleavage of recombinant SP1 by recombinant caspase 3 (CPP32) or caspase 7 (Mch 3) results in similar cleavage products as those observed in vivo.

# T4 Protein S7 52 61 778 787 caspase 3
# T5 Protein S7 63 68 789 794 CPP32
# T6 Protein S7 73 82 799 808 caspase 7
# T7 Protein S7 84 89 810 815 Mch 3

Recombinant caspase 6 (Mch 2) primarily generates a 68-kDa cleavage product, as observed after calcium ionophore (CaI) induced B-cell apoptosis.
# T8 Protein S8 12 21 893 902 caspase 6
# T9 Protein S8 23 28 904 909 Mch 2

In contrast, caspase 1 (ICE) did not cleave SP1 in vitro.
# T10 Protein S9 13 22 1039 1048 caspase 1
# T11 Protein S9 24 27 1050 1053 ICE
# T12 Protein S9 44 47 1070 1073 SP1

The time course of SP1 cleavage during anti-IgM-induced apoptosis is paralleled by an increase of caspase activity measured by DEVD-p-nitroanilide (DEVD-pNA) cleavage.
# T13 Protein S10 19 22 1103 1106 SP1

DNA band-shift assays revealed a decrease in the intensity of the full length SP1/DNA complex and an increase in the intensity of a smaller complex due to the binding of one SP1 cleavage product.
# T14 Protein S11 78 81 1330 1333 SP1
# T15 Protein S11 174 177 1426 1429 SP1

By Edman sequencing we could identify a caspase 3 cleavage site after Asp584 (D584AQPQAGR), generating a 22-kDa C-terminal SP1 protein fragment which still contains the DNA binding site.
# T16 Protein S12 40 49 1488 1497 caspase 3
# T17 Protein S12 123 126 1571 1574 SP1

Our results show the cleavage of the human transcription factor SP1 in vivo and in vitro, underlining the central role of caspase 3-like proteases during the process of anti-IgM-induced apoptosis.
