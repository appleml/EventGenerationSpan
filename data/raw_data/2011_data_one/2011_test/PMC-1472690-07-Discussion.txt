Discussion

Animal models of sepsis and myocardial injury suggest that a beta-1-->3-D-glucan like GP mediates its protective mechanisms, in part, via a rapid shift from NFkappaB- to PI3K-signaling [22,37].

Our study provides novel evidence that downstream of recognition and signaling pro-inflammatory transcription factor binding and cytokine expression of human leukocytes is switched to an anti-inflammatory phenotype by GP.

We confirmed and extended previous results [13-16] indicating that, in the absence of other stimuli, beta-1-->3-D-glucans induced binding of NFkappaB-, NFIL-6- and NFAT-mers to cytokine promoters.
# T1 Protein S4 152 158 580 586 NFIL-6
# T2 Protein S4 164 168 592 596 NFAT

Because of the multiple band shifts observed for NFAT binding (Fig. 1A), one could speculate that there is activation of several different NFAT isoforms, probably derived from alternative splicing [38].
# T3 Protein S5 49 53 674 678 NFAT
# T4 Protein S5 139 143 764 768 NFAT

Interestingly, the GP-induced transcription factor binding transformed only into a very limited cytokine response, namely IL-8 and IL-1RA (Fig. 3B).

# T6 Protein S6 122 126 950 954 IL-8
# T7 Protein S6 131 137 959 965 IL-1RA

Hence, our data are in aggreement with the few reports describing a beta-1-->3-D-glucan-mediated IL-8 [6,16,19] and IL-1RA production [17].
# T8 Protein S7 97 101 1074 1078 IL-8
# T9 Protein S7 116 122 1093 1099 IL-1RA

In addition, our EMSA/supershift and immunoblotting results demonstrated a GP-mediated predominant binding of NFkappaB p65 and to a lesser extent of p50 to a kappaB consensus site of the IL-8 promoter (Figs. 1A, 2).
# T10 Protein S8 119 122 1236 1239 p65
# T11 Protein S8 149 152 1266 1269 p50
# T12 Protein S8 187 191 1304 1308 IL-8

Results by Schulte and colleagues [28] pointed to an induction of IL-8 transcription depending on activation via an NFkappaB p65/65 homodimer, rather than via p65/50 heterodimers, which might be the case for the GP-mediated IL-8 transcription.

# T14 Protein S9 125 128 1458 1461 p65

# T17 Protein S9 163 165 1496 1498 50
# T18 Protein S9 224 228 1557 1561 IL-8

A GP-mediated IL-8 transcription based upon a cooperation between transactivated NFkappaB p65 and NFIL-6 [13,39] or NFATc2 dimer binding to the IL-8kappaB site [38] seems also possible.
# T19 Protein S10 14 18 1591 1595 IL-8

# T22 Protein S10 116 122 1693 1699 NFATc2
# T23 Protein S10 144 148 1721 1725 IL-8

The IL-8kappaB consensus site exhibits a preferentially p65 binding half site and thus differs from the kappaB half site described for TNFalpha and IL-1beta [27,40], supporting the idea of regulating NFkappaB binding through combinatorial associations of the subunits and the specific sequence of the decameric kappaB motif [41,42].

# T25 Protein S11 56 59 1819 1822 p65
# T26 Protein S11 135 143 1898 1906 TNFalpha
# T27 Protein S11 148 156 1911 1919 IL-1beta

Unlike LPS or TSST-1, we found that GP did not induce IL-1beta, but it strongly induced IL-1RA, suggesting an immediate anti-inflammatory potential of GP.
# T28 Protein S12 14 20 2110 2116 TSST-1
# T29 Protein S12 54 62 2150 2158 IL-1beta
# T30 Protein S12 88 94 2184 2190 IL-1RA

Analysing the IL-1RA promoter [34], we discovered four new binding sites (Fig. 8): an NFkappaB3 site (between -100 and -130), an NFkappaB consensus site (-266 and -280), another NFkappaB2/3 site (-288 and -302) and a more distal NFATP2/3 site (-471 and -490).
# T31 Protein S13 14 20 2265 2271 IL-1RA

Our data indicated that GP leads to production of IL-1RA primarily via induction of NFATP2/3 and NFIL-6 DNA binding, which might be due to differences in the binding motif or the composition of the activated transcription factors (NFAT) between the IFNgamma, IL-6 and IL-1RA promoter.
# T32 Protein S14 84 90 2595 2601 NFATP2
# T33 Protein S14 91 92 2602 2603 3
# T34 Protein S14 97 103 2608 2614 NFIL-6
# T35 Protein S14 231 235 2742 2746 NFAT
# T36 Protein S14 249 257 2760 2768 IFNgamma
# T37 Protein S14 259 263 2770 2774 IL-6
# T38 Protein S14 268 274 2779 2785 IL-1RA

The differential decrease of NFkappaB, NFAT and NFIL-6 binding to sites in the IL-1RA promoter as well as of IL-1RA mRNA and protein induced by selective inhibitors prior to GP treatment might suggest that these steps are linked to each other and necessary for induction of IL-1RA (Fig. 7).

# T40 Protein S15 48 54 2844 2850 NFIL-6

# T43 Protein S15 274 280 3070 3076 IL-1RA

Regarding cellular sources, both, monocytes as well as neutrophils have been reported to produce IL-1RA [32].
# T44 Protein S16 97 103 3184 3190 IL-1RA

Flow cytometric experiments seemed to confirm that monocytes and neutrophils were able to produce IL-8 just as IL-1RA in response to GP (data not shown).
# T45 Protein S17 98 102 3295 3299 IL-8
# T46 Protein S17 111 117 3308 3314 IL-1RA

This GP-induced cytokine profile was substantially more restricted than that of LPS or TSST-1, which is likely due to differences in recognition and signaling between LPS, TSST-1 and GP.
# T47 Protein S18 87 93 3438 3444 TSST-1
# T48 Protein S18 172 178 3523 3529 TSST-1

Recognition of LPS is mainly mediated through Toll-like receptor 4 and subsequent signaling via the NFkappaB pathway, leading to expression of pro-inflammatory mediators like TNFalpha [43].
# T49 Protein S19 46 66 3584 3604 Toll-like receptor 4
# T50 Protein S19 175 183 3713 3721 TNFalpha

A bacterial superantigen like TSST-1 acts through binding to MHC-II molecules and subsequently the T cell receptor, leading to release of mainly IFNgamma and TNFalpha, the latter via both, PI3K and p38 mitogen-activated kinase signaling [44,45].
# T51 Protein S20 30 36 3758 3764 TSST-1
# T52 Protein S20 145 153 3873 3881 IFNgamma
# T53 Protein S20 158 166 3886 3894 TNFalpha
# T54 Protein S20 198 226 3926 3954 p38 mitogen-activated kinase

Altogether, the induction of the neutrophil-attracting IL-8 and the anti-inflammatory IL-1RA by fungal carbohydrates (GP) may well fit to a benign PAMP response, mounting defensive mechanisms against a possible microbial attack.
# T55 Protein S21 55 59 4029 4033 IL-8
# T56 Protein S21 86 92 4060 4066 IL-1RA

Potentially even more relevant than the specific cytokine panel induced by GP, we found that, in the presence of other stimuli (LPS or TSST-1), GP ameliorated their pro-inflammatory immune reactions, similar to the effects in murine models of sepsis and inflammation [21-24].
# T57 Protein S22 135 141 4339 4345 TSST-1

Mainly, GP altered the TSST-1-induced IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio from a pro- to an anti-inflammatory profile via down-regulation of IL-1beta and IL-6, at the same time there was a synergistic up-regulation of IL-1RA.
# T58 Protein S23 23 29 4503 4509 TSST-1
# T59 Protein S23 38 46 4518 4526 IL-1beta
# T60 Protein S23 47 53 4527 4533 IL-1RA
# T61 Protein S23 127 135 4607 4615 IL-1beta
# T62 Protein S23 140 144 4620 4624 IL-6
# T63 Protein S23 204 210 4684 4690 IL-1RA

In part, this change may be caused by GP-mediated modulations of the TSST-1 induced binding of NFkappaB, NFIL-6 and NFAT to known and up to now unknown sites within the IL-8 and IL-1RA promoter instead of the TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 or IFNgamma promoter.

# T65 Protein S24 105 111 4797 4803 NFIL-6
# T66 Protein S24 116 120 4808 4812 NFAT
# T67 Protein S24 169 173 4861 4865 IL-8
# T68 Protein S24 178 184 4870 4876 IL-1RA

# T72 Protein S24 237 245 4929 4937 IFNgamma

Accordingly, we found that the TSST-1-induced binding of NFkappaB to sites from the TNFalpha promoter negatively correlated with the GP-mediated enhancement of the TSST-1-induced IL-1RA production (r = -0.88; p < 0.01; data not shown in detail).
# T73 Protein S25 31 37 4979 4985 TSST-1
# T74 Protein S25 84 92 5032 5040 TNFalpha
# T75 Protein S25 164 170 5112 5118 TSST-1
# T76 Protein S25 179 185 5127 5133 IL-1RA

Of the four examined NFkappaB sites from the IL-1RA promoter, mostly the TSST-1- and LPS-induced binding to the NFkappaB3 and the TSST-1-induced binding to the new NFkappaB consensus site seemed to be increased by GP.
# T77 Protein S26 45 51 5239 5245 IL-1RA
# T78 Protein S26 73 79 5267 5273 TSST-1
# T79 Protein S26 130 136 5324 5330 TSST-1

So, while we observed a GP-mediated down-regulation of the LPS- and the TSST-1-induced NFkappaB binding to sites of the TNFalpha promoter, there was an up-regulation to NFkappaB3 and NFkappaB consensus sites of the IL-1RA promoter.
# T80 Protein S27 72 78 5484 5490 TSST-1
# T81 Protein S27 120 128 5532 5540 TNFalpha
# T82 Protein S27 215 221 5627 5633 IL-1RA

These seemingly contradictory data could be explained by differences in either NFkappaB subunits or conserved nucleotides (#1, 2, 3, 10) within the decameric NFkappaB binding motif between the TNFalpha and the IL-1RA promoter (for NFkappaB3 the IL-1RA motif contains a T on position 10 instead of the conserved C in the TNFalpha motif, see Table 1), probably leading to differences in binding [41,42].
# T83 Protein S28 193 201 5837 5845 TNFalpha
# T84 Protein S28 210 216 5854 5860 IL-1RA

Despite the location of the new NFkappaB consensus site (-266 and -280) in the inhibitory element (-250 and -294) of the IL-1RA promoter [30], we observed no inhibition.
# T85 Protein S29 121 127 6167 6173 IL-1RA

On the other side, we found an inhibitory NFkappaB2/3 site (-288 and -302) towards the end of the inhibitory element, demonstrating down-regulations of the LPS- and TSST-1-induced binding, which could not be altered by GP.
# T86 Protein S30 165 171 6381 6387 TSST-1

In our opinion, this site may therefore represent at least a part of the previoulsy described inhibitory element [30].

The GP-modulated increase in TSST-1-induced binding to the new NFkappaB3 and NFkappaB consensus site, the NFIL-6 site [32] as well as to the novel NFATP2/3 site may explain the synergistic up-regulation of the TSST-1-induced IL-1RA production.
# T87 Protein S32 29 35 6587 6593 TSST-1
# T88 Protein S32 210 216 6768 6774 TSST-1
# T89 Protein S32 225 231 6783 6789 IL-1RA

We think that this GP-modulated activation of transcription was reflected by the decrease of the IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio following GP + TSST-1 (Fig. 6).
# T90 Protein S33 97 105 6899 6907 IL-1beta
# T91 Protein S33 106 112 6908 6914 IL-1RA
# T92 Protein S33 134 140 6936 6942 TSST-1

In this context, it has been postulated that in vitro a 100fold excess of IL-1RA over IL-1beta might control the biological effects of IL-1 [46,47].
# T93 Protein S34 74 80 7027 7033 IL-1RA
# T94 Protein S34 86 94 7039 7047 IL-1beta
# T95 Protein S34 135 139 7088 7092 IL-1

Since, in fact, the IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio following GP + TSST-1 is partially less than 0.01, it is not unreasonable to assume that IL-1beta bioactivity is inactivated in our system.
# T96 Protein S35 20 28 7122 7130 IL-1beta
# T97 Protein S35 29 35 7131 7137 IL-1RA
# T98 Protein S35 57 63 7159 7165 TSST-1
# T99 Protein S35 131 139 7233 7241 IL-1beta

Indeed, GP reduced the TSST-1-induced, IL-1-dependent IL-2 production of murine EL-4 cells (data not shown in detail).
# T100 Protein S36 23 29 7307 7313 TSST-1
# T101 Protein S36 39 43 7323 7327 IL-1
# T102 Protein S36 54 58 7338 7342 IL-2

The weaker modulating effects of GP on the LPS-induced immune response observed in this study, may be attributed to delicately balanced differences in signaling pathways between LPS and TSST-1 [43-45].
# T103 Protein S37 186 192 7590 7596 TSST-1

TSST-1 has been shown to use the PI3K pathway for signaling [44] and this effect may be sustained by GP treatment [22,37].
# T104 Protein S38 0 6 7606 7612 TSST-1

It has been demonstrated that in septic/LPS-adapted leukocytes the PI3K pathway selectively controls sIL-1RA but not IL-1beta production [48].
# T105 Protein S39 102 108 7831 7837 IL-1RA
# T106 Protein S39 117 125 7846 7854 IL-1beta

Signaling via PI3K has been reported to be involved in the activation of NFAT in T cells [49].
# T107 Protein S40 73 77 7945 7949 NFAT

Activation of NFkappaB can also take place via PI3K [50], which may offer an explanation for a difference in signaling between GP (PI3K) and LPS (mitogen-activated kinase signaling).

This idea may be supported by another study showing that despite the use of similar PRR, LPS and peptidoglycan activated the IL-1RA gene through different mechanisms/DNA-binding proteins and acted synergistically in combination, suggestive of signals which are not equivalent in all parts [51].
