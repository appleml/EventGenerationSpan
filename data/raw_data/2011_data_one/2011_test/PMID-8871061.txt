Molecular mechanisms of steroid action: a novel type of cross-talk between glucocorticoids and NF-kappa B transcription factors.

Despite the widespread use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of diseases characterized by inflammation, the molecular mechanism(s) by which these hormones exert this beneficial effect in patients with asthma remains to be elucidated.

Therefore, we have studied the transcriptional regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as adhesion molecules are likely to play a causal role in inflammation in promoting cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions.
# T1 Protein S3 61 94 427 460 intercellular adhesion molecule-1
# T2 Protein S3 96 102 462 468 ICAM-1

We observed that in a monocytic (U937) and a bronchial epithelial (H292) cell-line dexamethasone strongly suppressed basal and induced ICAM-1 expression.
# T3 Protein S4 135 141 729 735 ICAM-1

Subsequent analysis of the human ICAM-1 promoter has revealed that both 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) upregulate ICAM-1 expression through the presence of a nuclear factor (NF-kappa B) target sequence (TGGAAATTCC).
# T4 Protein S5 33 39 781 787 ICAM-1
# T5 Protein S5 119 147 867 895 tumour necrosis factor-alpha
# T6 Protein S5 149 158 897 906 TNF-alpha
# T7 Protein S5 171 177 919 925 ICAM-1

No glucocorticoid recognition sequences are present in this promoter region and dexamethasone is still able to repress transcription when the multimerized NF-kappa B sequence is transactivated by TNF-alpha upon transfection in 293 cells.
# T8 Protein S6 196 205 1217 1226 TNF-alpha

We propose that direct interaction between the glucocorticoid receptor and nuclear factor-kappa B factors is at least a partial explanation for the effects of this hormone in inflammatory diseases.
# T9 Protein S7 47 70 1306 1329 glucocorticoid receptor
