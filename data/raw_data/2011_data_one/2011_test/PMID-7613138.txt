The interleukin-5/receptor interaction activates Lyn and Jak2 tyrosine kinases and propagates signals via the Ras-Raf-1-MAP kinase and the Jak-STAT pathways in eosinophils.
# T1 Protein S1 4 17 4 17 interleukin-5
# T2 Protein S1 49 52 49 52 Lyn
# T3 Protein S1 57 78 57 78 Jak2 tyrosine kinases
# T4 Protein S1 114 119 114 119 Raf-1

We have shown that the interaction of interleukin (IL)-5 with the receptor activates Lyn tyrosine kinase within 1 min and Jak2 tyrosine kinase within 1-3 min.
# T5 Protein S2 38 56 212 230 interleukin (IL)-5
# T6 Protein S2 85 104 259 278 Lyn tyrosine kinase
# T7 Protein S2 122 142 296 316 Jak2 tyrosine kinase

IL-5 also stimulates GTP binding to p21ras.
# T8 Protein S3 0 4 333 337 IL-5
# T9 Protein S3 36 42 369 375 p21ras

The signal is subsequently propagated through the activation of Raf-1, MEK, and MAP kinases as shown by their increased autophosphorylation in vitro and phosphorylation in situ.
# T10 Protein S4 64 69 441 446 Raf-1

Jak2 kinase has been shown to phosphorylate STAT nuclear proteins.
# T11 Protein S5 0 11 555 566 Jak2 kinase

The activation of STAT nuclear factors was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a gamma activation site (GAS) probe.

We found that IL-5 induces two GAS-binding proteins in eosinophils, one of which is STAT1.
# T12 Protein S7 14 18 770 774 IL-5

We conclude that IL-5 induced signals are propagated through two distinct pathways: (1) Lyn-->Ras-->Raf-1-->MEK-->MAP kinase and (2) Jak2-->STAT1.
