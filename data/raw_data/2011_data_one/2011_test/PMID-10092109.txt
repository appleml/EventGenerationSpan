Interferon-beta mediates stromal cell rescue of T cells from apoptosis.
# T1 Protein S1 0 15 0 15 Interferon-beta

The resolution of immune responses is characterized by extensive apoptosis of activated T cells.

However, to generate and maintain immunological memory, some antigen-specific T cells must survive and revert to a resting G0/G1 state.

Cytokines that bind to the common gamma chain of the IL-2 receptor promote the survival of T cell blasts, but also induce proliferation.
# T2 Protein S4 53 57 359 363 IL-2

In contrast, soluble factors secreted by stromal cells induce Tcell survival in a resting G0/G1 state.

We now report that interferon-beta is the principal mediator of stromal cell-mediated Tcell rescue from apoptosis.
# T3 Protein S6 19 34 565 580 interferon-beta

Interferon-alpha and -beta promote the reversion of blast Tcells to a resting G0/G1 configuration with all the characteristic features of stromal cell rescue; such as high Bcl-XL expression and low Bcl-2.

# T5 Protein S7 198 203 859 864 Bcl-2

Type I interferons and stromal cells stimulate apparently identical signaling pathways, leading to STAT-1 activation.
# T6 Protein S8 99 105 965 971 STAT-1

We also show that this mechanism may play a fundamental role in the persistence of T cells at sites of chronic inflammation; suggesting that chronic inflammation is an aberrant consequence of immunological memory.
