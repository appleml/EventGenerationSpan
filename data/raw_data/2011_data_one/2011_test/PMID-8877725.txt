Regulation of interferon-gamma gene expression.
# T1 Protein S1 14 30 14 30 interferon-gamma

Interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ), also known as type II interferon, is an important immunoregulatory gene that has multiple effects on the development, maturation, and function of the immune system.
# T2 Protein S2 0 16 49 65 Interferon-gamma
# T3 Protein S2 19 28 68 77 IFN-gamma
# T4 Protein S2 46 64 95 113 type II interferon

IFN-gamma mRNA and protein are expressed predominantly by T cells and large granular lymphocytes.
# T5 Protein S3 0 9 246 255 IFN-gamma

The IFN-gamma mRNA is induced/inhibited in these cell types by a wide variety of extracellular signals, thus implicating a number of diverse, yet convergent signal transduction pathways in its transcriptional control.
# T6 Protein S4 4 13 348 357 IFN-gamma

In this review, I describe how DNA methylation and specific DNA binding proteins may regulate transcription of the IFN-gamma gene in response to extracellular signals.
