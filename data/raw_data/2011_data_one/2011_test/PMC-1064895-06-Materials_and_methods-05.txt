Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of IL-17
# T1 Protein S1 37 42 37 42 IL-17

IL-17 in culture supernatants was measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously [20].
# T2 Protein S2 0 5 43 48 IL-17

In brief, a 96-well plate (Nunc) was coated with 4 mug/ml monoclonal antibodies against IL-17 (R & D Systems) at 4degreesC overnight.
# T3 Protein S3 88 93 250 255 IL-17

After blocking with phosphate-buffered saline/1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/0.05% Tween 20 for 2 hours at room temperature (22-25degreesC), test samples and the standard recombinant IL-17 (R & D Systems) were added to the 96-well plate and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours.
# T4 Protein S4 182 187 478 483 IL-17

Plates were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20, and then incubated with 500 ng/ml biotinylated mouse monoclonal antibodies against IL-17 (R & D Systems) for 2 hours at room temperature.
# T5 Protein S5 154 159 733 738 IL-17

After washing, streptavidin-alkaline phosphate-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) was incubated for 2 hours, then washed again and incubated with 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) dissolved in diethanolamine (Sigma) to develop the color reaction.

The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 M NaOH and the optical density of each well was read at 405 nm.

The lower limit of IL-17 detection was 10 pg/ml.
# T6 Protein S8 19 24 1176 1181 IL-17

Recombinant human IL-17 diluted in culture medium was used as a calibration standard, ranging from 10 to 2000 pg/ml.
# T7 Protein S9 18 23 1224 1229 IL-17

A standard curve was drawn by plotting optical density against the log of the concentration of recombinant cytokines, and used for determination of IL-17 in test samples.
# T8 Protein S10 148 153 1471 1476 IL-17
