Evidence for normal vitamin D receptor messenger ribonucleic acid and genotype in absorptive hypercalciuria.
# T1 Protein S1 20 38 20 38 vitamin D receptor

Absorptive hypercalciuria (a stone-forming condition) is characterized by gut hyperabsorption of calcium, hypercalciuria, and reduced bone density.

Inasmuch as these features implicate enhanced calcitriol action in gut and bone, we analyzed the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene to ascertain whether an abnormality of this gene marks patients with intestinal hyperabsorption of calcium.
# T2 Protein S3 97 115 355 373 vitamin D receptor
# T3 Protein S3 117 120 375 378 VDR

We have compared the frequency of a restriction fragment length polymorphism (Bsm I) associated with different alleles of the VDR gene in a group of 33 well characterized absorptive hypercalciuric patients and a group of 36 normal race- and age-matched control subjects.
# T4 Protein S4 126 129 619 622 VDR

There was no difference between the distribution of the VDR alleles in the patient population when compared with the normal population.
# T5 Protein S5 56 59 820 823 VDR

The coding region of VDR messenger RNA was also normal, as determined by both DNA sequence analysis and chemical mismatch cleavage analysis of copy DNA from 11 index absorptive hypercalciuric patients.
# T6 Protein S6 21 24 921 924 VDR

On the basis of these results, we propose that the enhanced intestinal calcium absorption invariably seen in absorptive hypercalciuria and attendant symptoms of this disorder are not attributable to mutations of the VDR and are not linked to a common VDR genotype.
