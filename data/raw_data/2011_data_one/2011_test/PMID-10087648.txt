T helper differentiation proceeds through Stat1-dependent, Stat4-dependent and Stat4-independent phases.

Much of our focus in understanding Th1/Th2 development has been on the signals delivered by IL-12 and IL-4 as final determinants of terminal T cell differentiation.

Because extinction of IL-12 signaling in early Th2 development could potentially be important in imprinting a more permanent Th2 phenotype on a population of T cells, we have also examined various parameters regulating the IL-12 signaling pathway.

Whereas IL-4 appears to repress functional IL-12 signaling through inhibition of IL-12R beta 2 expression, IFN-gamma in the mouse, and IFN-alpha in the human appear to induce IL-12R beta 2 expression and promote IL-12 responsiveness.

# T6 Protein S4 81 94 600 613 IL-12R beta 2

# T8 Protein S4 175 188 694 707 IL-12R beta 2

We propose that Th1 development can be considered in two stages, capacitance and development.

Capacitance would simply involve expression of IL-12R beta 1 and beta 2 subunits, regulated by TCR, IL-4 and IFNs.
# T9 Protein S6 47 60 894 907 IL-12R beta 1
# T10 Protein S6 65 71 912 918 beta 2
# T11 Protein S6 100 104 947 951 IL-4

The second stage, development, we propose is the true IL-12 induced developmental stage, involving expression of Stat4 inducible proteins.
# T12 Protein S7 113 118 1075 1080 Stat4

In the human, this may also occur via IFN-alpha, which is able to activate Stat4.
# T13 Protein S8 75 80 1176 1181 Stat4

It is perhaps possible that all of Stat4 actions on Th1 development may be exert directly by Stat4 at the IFN-gamma gene, however we suggest that, more likely, Stat4 may act to induce Th1 development through the induction of other non-cytokine genes, whose stable expression maintains the transcriptional state of a Th1 cell.
