Decreased concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptors in peripheral mononuclear cells of patients with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets: effect of phosphate supplementation.
# T1 Protein S1 27 60 27 60 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor

Abnormal renal tubular phosphate transport is considered to be the primary defect in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH).

However, the resistance to vitamin D treatment in XLH cannot be explained by hypophosphatemia alone.

Since most of the actions of vitamin D are mediated by its receptors (VDR), abnormalities of VDR have been postulated in XLH.
# T2 Protein S4 70 73 481 484 VDR
# T3 Protein S4 93 96 504 507 VDR

In order to investigate this possibility, we measured the concentration of VDR in PHA-activated peripheral mononuclear cells from 10 XLH patients.
# T4 Protein S5 75 78 612 615 VDR

Patients without phosphate supplementation showed significantly lower concentration (21.7 +/- 5.1 fmol/mg protein, mean +/- SEM) compared to the normal controls (60.7 +/- 4.0).

On the contrary, there was no significant difference between the phosphate-supplemented patients (58.3 +/- 2.7) and controls.

There was a significant positive correlation between VDR concentration and serum phosphate (P less than 0.05).
# T5 Protein S8 53 56 1040 1043 VDR

In two patients, VDR was increased after daily phosphate supplementation was started.
# T6 Protein S9 17 20 1115 1118 VDR

These results indicate that a decreased concentration of VDR secondary to persistent hypophosphatemia is one of the causes of vitamin D resistance in XLH.
# T7 Protein S10 57 60 1241 1244 VDR
