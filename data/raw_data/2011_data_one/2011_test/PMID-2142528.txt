Two distinct forms of active transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element binding protein).
# T1 Protein S1 50 54 50 54 CREB
# T2 Protein S1 56 93 56 93 cAMP response element binding protein

Mammalian cells express two distinct forms of transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) that are apparently the products of alternative splicing of the CREB gene transcript.
# T3 Protein S2 67 71 164 168 CREB
# T4 Protein S2 73 110 170 207 cAMP response element binding protein
# T5 Protein S2 176 180 273 277 CREB

The two proteins differ by a 14-amino acid serine-rich insertion present in one of the CREB isoforms.
# T6 Protein S3 87 91 382 386 CREB

We show that both CREB isoforms are expressed in many cell types and mammalian species.
# T7 Protein S4 18 22 415 419 CREB

Both encode proteins that bind specifically to a cAMP response element in vitro.

As expected for proteins of this class, the CREB proteins bind DNA as dimers.
# T8 Protein S6 44 48 610 614 CREB

Both proteins impart cAMP-regulated transcriptional activity to a heterologous DNA-binding domain, showing that cAMP directly modulates the transcriptional stimulatory activity of CREB.
# T9 Protein S7 180 184 824 828 CREB

The presence of multiple CREB isoforms with identical DNA-binding specificities but differences in the presumed regulatory domain raises the possibility that CREB proteins may be able to integrate distinct regulatory signals at the level of gene transcription.
# T10 Protein S8 25 29 855 859 CREB
# T11 Protein S8 158 162 988 992 CREB
