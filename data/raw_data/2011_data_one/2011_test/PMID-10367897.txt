CBP/p300 integrates Raf/Rac-signaling pathways in the transcriptional induction of NF-ATc during T cell activation.

# T2 Protein S1 4 8 4 8 p300
# T3 Protein S1 83 89 83 89 NF-ATc

NF-ATc, an inducibly expressed transcription factor, controls gene expression in T lymphocytes and cardiomyocytes.
# T4 Protein S2 0 6 117 123 NF-ATc

We show here that the transcriptional co-activators CBP/p300 bind to and control the activity of the inducible N-terminal transactivation domain of NF-ATc, TAD-A.
# T5 Protein S3 52 55 284 287 CBP
# T6 Protein S3 56 60 288 292 p300
# T7 Protein S3 148 154 380 386 NF-ATc

Similar to the N terminal transactivation domain of c-Jun, TAD-A is inducibly phosphorylated, but this phosphorylation is dispensable for the interaction with CBP/p300.
# T8 Protein S4 52 57 447 452 c-Jun
# T9 Protein S4 159 162 554 557 CBP
# T10 Protein S4 163 167 558 562 p300

Constitutive active versions of c-Raf and Rac synergistically enhance the CBP/p300-mediated increase of TAD-A activity, indicating the important role CBP/p300 plays in the integration of T cell activation signals.
# T11 Protein S5 32 37 596 601 c-Raf
# T12 Protein S5 74 77 638 641 CBP
# T13 Protein S5 78 82 642 646 p300
# T14 Protein S5 150 153 714 717 CBP
# T15 Protein S5 154 158 718 722 p300

Since a mutation of CBP abolishing HAT activity is almost as active as wild-type CBP in T cells, functions of CBP/p300 other than histone acetylation appear to control the NF-AT-dependent transcription in T cells.
