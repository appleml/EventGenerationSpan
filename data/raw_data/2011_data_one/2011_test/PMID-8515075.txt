Transcriptional activation of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene by IL-2 is associated with secretion of bioactive macrophage colony-stimulating factor protein by monocytes and involves activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B.
# T1 Protein S1 79 83 79 83 IL-2
# T2 Protein S1 126 162 126 162 macrophage colony-stimulating factor

Human peripheral blood monocytes (Mo) constitutively display the beta-chain of the receptor for IL-2, whereas expression of the IL-2R alpha-chain is not constitutive but inducible with IL-2.
# T3 Protein S2 96 100 345 349 IL-2
# T4 Protein S2 128 139 377 388 IL-2R alpha
# T5 Protein S2 185 189 434 438 IL-2

Here we report that binding of human IL-2 to its binding site leads to transcriptional activation of the macrophage CSF (M-CSF) gene in Mo resulting in accumulation of M-CSF mRNA and subsequent release of bioactive M-CSF protein as demonstrated by ELISA and inhibition of IL-2 induced release of an activity-stimulating growth of monocyte-type colonies by a neutralizing anti-M-CSF antibody.
# T6 Protein S3 37 41 477 481 IL-2
# T7 Protein S3 105 119 545 559 macrophage CSF
# T8 Protein S3 121 126 561 566 M-CSF
# T9 Protein S3 168 173 608 613 M-CSF
# T10 Protein S3 215 220 655 660 M-CSF
# T11 Protein S3 272 276 712 716 IL-2
# T12 Protein S3 376 381 816 821 M-CSF

Transcriptional activation of the M-CSF gene by IL-2 is preceded by enhanced binding activity of the transcription factor NF-kappa B to its recognition sequence in the 5' regulatory enhancer region of the M-CSF gene.
# T13 Protein S4 34 39 866 871 M-CSF
# T14 Protein S4 48 52 880 884 IL-2
# T15 Protein S4 205 210 1037 1042 M-CSF

Moreover, using a heterologous promoter (herpes thymidine kinase) construct containing the NF-kappa B consensus sequence, it is shown that NF-kappa B binding by an IL-2-induced monocyte-derived nuclear protein confers reporter gene (human growth hormone) activity.
# T16 Protein S5 164 168 1213 1217 IL-2

Taken together, our findings indicate that IL-2 induces gene expression of M-CSF in human blood-derived Mo and provide evidence for involvement of NF-kappa B in transcriptional regulation of this gene.

# T18 Protein S6 75 80 1389 1394 M-CSF
