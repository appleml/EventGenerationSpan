The c-rel protooncogene product represses NF-kappa B p65-mediated transcriptional activation of the long terminal repeat of type 1 human immunodeficiency virus.

The long terminal repeat (LTR) of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and the 5' regulatory region of the gene encoding the interleukin 2 receptor alpha subunit (IL-2R alpha) share functional kappa B enhancer elements involved in the regulation of these inducible transcription units during T-cell activation.
# T3 Protein S2 136 172 298 334 interleukin 2 receptor alpha subunit
# T4 Protein S2 174 185 336 347 IL-2R alpha

These kappa B enhancer elements are recognized by a structurally related family of interactive proteins that includes p50, p65, and the product of the c-rel protooncogene (c-Rel).

Recent biochemical studies have shown that p65 and p50 form the prototypical NF-kappa B complex, which is rapidly translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during T-cell activation.

# T10 Protein S4 51 54 715 718 p50

This intracellular signaling complex potently stimulates kappa B-directed transcription from either the HIV-1 LTR or the IL-2R alpha promoter via the strong transactivation domain present in p65.

# T12 Protein S5 191 194 1042 1045 p65

We now demonstrate that nuclear expression of human c-Rel, which is induced by either phorbol ester or tumor necrosis factor alpha with delayed kinetics relative to p65, markedly represses p65-mediated activation of these transcription units.
# T13 Protein S6 52 57 1099 1104 c-Rel
# T14 Protein S6 103 130 1150 1177 tumor necrosis factor alpha
# T15 Protein S6 165 168 1212 1215 p65
# T16 Protein S6 189 192 1236 1239 p65

These inhibitory effects of c-Rel correlate with its DNA-binding activity but not with its ability to heterodimerize with p50, suggesting that c-Rel inhibition involves competition with p50/p65 for occupancy of the kappa B enhancer element.
# T17 Protein S7 28 33 1318 1323 c-Rel
# T18 Protein S7 122 125 1412 1415 p50
# T19 Protein S7 143 148 1433 1438 c-Rel
# T20 Protein S7 186 189 1476 1479 p50
# T21 Protein S7 190 193 1480 1483 p65

Together, these findings suggest that one function of c-Rel is as a physiologic repressor of the HIV-1 LTR and IL-2R alpha promoters, serving to efficiently counter the strong transcriptional activating effects of p65.
