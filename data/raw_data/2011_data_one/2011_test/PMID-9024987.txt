The NF-kappa B inhibitor, tepoxalin, suppresses surface expression of the cell adhesion molecules CD62E, CD11b/CD18 and CD106.

Tepoxalin, a dual enzyme inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase has been shown to inhibit T-cell activation.

Its immunosuppressive property is distinct from cyclosporin because only tepoxalin, but not cyclosporin, suppresses NF-kappa B activation.

Here we report that tepoxalin selectively inhibits intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54)/MAC-1 (CD11b/CD18) dependent adhesion of polymorphonuclear cells to IL-1 activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

# T10 Protein S4 168 172 552 556 IL-1

The mechanism of inhibition is related to the surface expression of several cell adhesion molecules.

Flow cytometry analyses on cultured cells that were treated with tepoxalin or antisense oligonucleotides to the P65/p50 subunit of NF-kappa B, and then stimulated with PMA, revealed a reduced expression of CD11b/CD18 on monocytic HL60 cells, and endothelial adhesion molecule-1 (CD62E) and vascular adhesion molecule-1 (CD106) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

# T18 Protein S6 320 325 1028 1033 CD106

Expression of other adhesion molecules such as lymphocyte function associated-antigen-1 (CD11a/CD18) and CD54 were unaffected.

# T20 Protein S7 95 99 1173 1177 CD18
# T21 Protein S7 105 109 1183 1187 CD54

Tepoxalin also inhibited the secretion of a NF-kappa B regulated chemokine, IL-8, a known inducer of CD11b/CD18 expression.
# T22 Protein S8 76 80 1281 1285 IL-8
# T23 Protein S8 101 106 1306 1311 CD11b
# T24 Protein S8 107 111 1312 1316 CD18

Thus the suppression of CD11b/CD18 expression by tepoxalin may involve IL-8.
# T25 Protein S9 24 29 1353 1358 CD11b
# T26 Protein S9 30 34 1359 1363 CD18
# T27 Protein S9 71 75 1400 1404 IL-8

Our results suggest that by inhibiting NF-kappa B activation, surface expression of several adhesion molecules can be modulated and that tepoxalin may be useful in treating selected adhesion mediated events such as leukocyte migration or atherosclerotic plaque formation.
