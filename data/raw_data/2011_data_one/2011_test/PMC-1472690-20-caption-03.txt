NFkappaB p65/p50 and NFATc2/c1 were involved in GP-induced DNA binding.
# T1 Protein S1 9 12 9 12 p65
# T2 Protein S1 13 16 13 16 p50
# T3 Protein S1 21 27 21 27 NFATc2
# T4 Protein S1 28 30 28 30 c1

In order to determine whether the DNA binding proteins activated by GP were related to NFkappaB and NFAT, an immuno(dot) blot was performed.
# T5 Protein S2 100 104 172 176 NFAT

A representative dot blot showing staining of negative and positive controls (recombinant proteins NFkappaB p52, c-rel; nuclear extracts of PMA-treated Jurkat cells positive for NFkappaB p50, p65 and for NFATc1, c2) in the upper panel and staining of nuclear extracts of GP-treated PBMC (positive for NFkappaB p65, p50 and NFAT c2, c1) in the lower panel is shown (n = 3).
