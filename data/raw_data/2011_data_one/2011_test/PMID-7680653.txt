Cell type- and stage-specific expression of the CD20/B1 antigen correlates with the activity of a diverged octamer DNA motif present in its promoter.
# T1 Protein S1 48 52 48 52 CD20
# T2 Protein S1 53 55 53 55 B1

The CD20(B1) gene encodes a B cell-specific protein involved in the regulation of human B cell proliferation and differentiation.

# T4 Protein S2 9 11 160 162 B1

Studies with 5' deletion CD20 promoter-CAT constructs have previously revealed two regions of the promoter between bases -186 and -280 and between bases -280 and -454 which contained positive regulatory elements.
# T5 Protein S3 25 29 306 310 CD20
# T6 Protein S3 39 42 320 323 CAT

In this study we identified a sequence element present in the most proximal region located between bases -214 and -201, TTCTTCTAATTAA, which is important in the high constitutive expression of CD20 in mature B cells and the induction of CD20 in pre-B cells.
# T7 Protein S4 193 197 687 691 CD20
# T8 Protein S4 237 241 731 735 CD20

This sequence element was referred to as the BAT box and its deletion significantly reduced the activity of a CD20 promoter-CAT construct in B cells.
# T9 Protein S5 110 114 862 866 CD20
# T10 Protein S5 124 127 876 879 CAT

Mobility shift assays with various mutant probes and B cell nuclear extracts demonstrated that the core sequence TAAT was essential for binding to this site.

Cross competition experiments with an octamer sequence from the Ig heavy chain promoter, the BAT box, and a TA-rich sequence present in the CD21 promoter revealed that all three sequences bound the same nuclear proteins suggesting that the BAT box binding proteins were Oct-1 and Oct-2.
# T11 Protein S7 140 144 1200 1204 CD21
# T12 Protein S7 270 275 1330 1335 Oct-1
# T13 Protein S7 280 285 1340 1345 Oct-2

Southwestern blotting and UV cross-linking studies confirmed that the BAT box binding proteins were Oct-1 and Oct-2.
# T14 Protein S8 100 105 1447 1452 Oct-1
# T15 Protein S8 110 115 1457 1462 Oct-2

The affinity of the BAT box binding proteins for the BAT box was approximately 25-fold less than for the octamer sequence and the BAT box binding proteins dissociated from the BAT box 10-fold more rapidly than from the octamer sequence.

Despite this lower affinity, a trimer of the BAT box sequence was as efficiently transactivated by an Oct-2 expression vector as was a trimer of the octamer sequence in HeLa cells.
# T16 Protein S10 102 107 1803 1808 Oct-2

The BAT box and Oct-2 were also implicated in the induction of CD20 in the pre-B cell line, PB-697, via phorbol esters.
# T17 Protein S11 16 21 1898 1903 Oct-2
# T18 Protein S11 63 67 1945 1949 CD20

The induction of CD20 mRNA was temporally associated with induction of Oct-2 mRNA and a BAT box-deleted CD20-CAT construct, in contrast to the wild type, was poorly induced by phorbol esters.
# T19 Protein S12 17 21 2019 2023 CD20
# T20 Protein S12 71 76 2073 2078 Oct-2
# T21 Protein S12 104 108 2106 2110 CD20

Together these results suggest that the BAT box binding proteins are important in the B cell specific expression of CD20 and perhaps CD21.
# T22 Protein S13 116 120 2310 2314 CD20
# T23 Protein S13 133 137 2327 2331 CD21
