Quantitation of globin mRNA.

RNA was first reverse transcribed to cDNA.

Primers for cDNA PCR amplification of globin genes were obtained from Primerbank [51].

All primers were searched against the NCBI database to confirm specificity.

For epsilony globin: MHB1666, 5'TGGCCTGTGGAGTAAGGTCAA3'; and MHB1667, 5'GAAGCAGAGGACAAGTTCCCA3'.
# T1 Protein S5 4 19 239 254 epsilony globin

For zeta globin: MHB1668, 5'CTACCCCCAGACGAAGACCTA3'; and MHB1669, 5'CTTAACCGCATCCCCTACGG3'.
# T2 Protein S6 4 15 336 347 zeta globin

For betaH1 globin: MHB1672, 5'TGGACAACCTCAAGGAGACC3'; and MHB1673, 5'ACCTCTGGGGTGAATTCCTT3'.
# T3 Protein S7 4 17 428 441 betaH1 globin

For betamaj/min globin: MHB1674: 5'ATGGCCTGAATCACTTGGAC3'; and MHB1675, 5'ACGATCATATTGCCCAGGAG3'.
# T4 Protein S8 4 11 521 528 betamaj
# T5 Protein S8 12 22 529 539 min globin

Using the SYBR green supermix kit with ROX (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, United States), PCR amplification was run on an ABI7000 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States) at the University of Arizona core facility.

All PCR was performed in a 25-mul reaction with 12.5 mul SYBR green supermix.

GAPDH mRNA levels were used as control for input RNA.
# T6 Protein S11 0 5 929 934 GAPDH

Standard curve analyses were performed to test the efficiency of the amplifications.

Triplicates were done for each PCR reaction.

Relative quantitative values were calculated in the ABI Prism 7000 SDS Software (Applied Biosystems) and normalized to GAPDH in Microsoft Excel (Redmond, Washington, United States).
# T7 Protein S14 119 124 1232 1237 GAPDH
