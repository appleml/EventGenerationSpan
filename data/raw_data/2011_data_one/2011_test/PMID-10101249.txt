Vitamin D receptor 3'-untranslated region polymorphisms: lack of effect on mRNA stability.
# T1 Protein S1 0 18 0 18 Vitamin D receptor

Allelic variation at the 3'-end of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene has been associated with a 3-5-fold increased risk of developing prostate cancer and with differences in bone mineralization.
# T2 Protein S2 39 57 131 149 vitamin D receptor
# T3 Protein S2 59 62 151 154 VDR

This genetic diversity does not alter the VDR protein structurally, but instead may be a marker(s) of other, nearby polymorphisms that influence message stability or translation.
# T4 Protein S3 42 45 329 332 VDR

The work reported here was instigated to identify additional VDR 3'-UTR polymorphisms that may have functional significance and to then test whether these genetic variants alter message stability.
# T5 Protein S4 61 64 527 530 VDR

Initially, four novel, frequently occurring sequence variants were identified that associated with two common haplotypes that were described previously.

These common sequence variants were not found within three message-destabilizing elements that we mapped within the 3'-UTR of the vitamin D receptor mRNA.
# T6 Protein S6 130 148 946 964 vitamin D receptor

Furthermore, the two VDR 3'-UTR haplotypes conferred an identical half-life on a heterologous beta-globin reporter gene, in an in vitro assay.
# T7 Protein S7 21 24 992 995 VDR

We therefore conclude that common polymorphisms within the VDR 3'-UTR do not influence message stability.
# T8 Protein S8 59 62 1173 1176 VDR
