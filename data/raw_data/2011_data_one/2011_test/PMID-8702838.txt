Elevated cyclic AMP inhibits NF-kappaB-mediated transcription in human monocytic cells and endothelial cells.

The NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors regulates the inducible expression of many genes in activated human monocytes and endothelial cells.

In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism by which agents that elevate intracellular cAMP inhibit the expression of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), tissue factor, endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 genes.
# T1 Protein S3 129 156 391 418 tumor necrosis factor alpha
# T2 Protein S3 158 166 420 428 TNFalpha
# T3 Protein S3 169 182 431 444 tissue factor
# T4 Protein S3 184 225 446 487 endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1
# T5 Protein S3 231 264 493 526 vascular cell adhesion molecule-1

Both forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP, which elevate intracellular cAMP by independent mechanisms, inhibited TNFalpha and tissue factor expression at the level of transcription.
# T6 Protein S4 105 113 639 647 TNFalpha
# T7 Protein S4 118 131 652 665 tissue factor

Induction of NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression in transiently transfected human monocytic THP-1 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells was inhibited by elevated cAMP and by overexpression of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA).

Elevated cAMP did not prevent nuclear translocation of p50/p65 and c-Rel/p65 heterodimers, decrease nuclear translocation of p65, or significantly modify TNFalpha-induced phosphorylation of p65.
# T8 Protein S6 55 58 1015 1018 p50
# T9 Protein S6 59 62 1019 1022 p65
# T10 Protein S6 67 72 1027 1032 c-Rel
# T11 Protein S6 73 76 1033 1036 p65
# T12 Protein S6 125 128 1085 1088 p65
# T13 Protein S6 154 162 1114 1122 TNFalpha
# T14 Protein S6 190 193 1150 1153 p65

Functional studies demonstrated that transcriptional activation of a plasmid containing multimerized kappaB sites by p65 was inhibited by agents that elevate cAMP and by overexpression of the catalytic subunit of PKA.
# T15 Protein S7 117 120 1272 1275 p65

This study indicates that activation of PKA reduces the induction of a distinct set of genes in monocytes and endothelial cells by inhibiting NF-kappaB-mediated transcription.
