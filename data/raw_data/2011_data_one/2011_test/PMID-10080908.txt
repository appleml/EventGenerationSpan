Analysis of the modulation of transcriptional activity in myelopoiesis and leukemogenesis.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still associated with a mortality of 60 to 80%.

AML is characterized by a block in myeloid differentiation.

The transcription factors PU.1 and C/EBPalpha are responsible for normal myeloid differentiation from stem cells to monocytes or granulocytes.
# T1 Protein S4 26 30 258 262 PU.1
# T2 Protein S4 35 45 267 277 C/EBPalpha

In particular, PU.1 induces expression of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor and the development of monocytes, whereas C/EBPalpha increases the expression of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor and leads to mature granulocytes.
# T3 Protein S5 15 19 390 394 PU.1
# T4 Protein S5 46 82 421 457 macrophage colony-stimulating factor
# T5 Protein S5 84 89 459 464 M-CSF
# T6 Protein S5 142 152 517 527 C/EBPalpha
# T7 Protein S5 185 239 560 614 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor

In AML, chromosomal aberrations result in oncoproteins such as AML1/ETO, PML/RARalpha, or activated Ras, which can deregulate genes important for normal myelopoiesis.
# T8 Protein S6 63 67 712 716 AML1
# T9 Protein S6 73 76 722 725 PML
# T10 Protein S6 77 85 726 734 RARalpha

Thus, AML1/ETO can bind to the transcription factor C/EBPalpha, inhibit C/EBPalpha-dependent transcription, and block granulocytic differentiation.
# T11 Protein S7 6 10 822 826 AML1
# T12 Protein S7 52 62 868 878 C/EBPalpha
# T13 Protein S7 72 82 888 898 C/EBPalpha

However, AML1/ETO can also synergize with the transcription factor AML1 to enhance the activity of the M-CSF receptor promoter.
# T14 Protein S8 9 13 973 977 AML1
# T15 Protein S8 67 71 1031 1035 AML1
# T16 Protein S8 103 108 1067 1072 M-CSF

On the other hand, the PML/RARalpha fusion protein causes transcriptional repression by recruiting the nuclear corepressor (N-CoR) histone deacetylase complex to the DNA, which results in decreased histone acetylation and a repressive chromatin organization.
# T17 Protein S9 23 26 1115 1118 PML
# T18 Protein S9 27 35 1119 1127 RARalpha

Here we describe methods to investigate whether and how signaling agonists induce myeloid differentiation and how oncoproteins might cause AML by modulating the activity of transcription factors that are pivotal for normal myeloid development.
