Increased proliferation, cytotoxicity, and gene expression after stimulation of human peripheral blood T lymphocytes through a surface ganglioside (GD3) [published erratum appears in J Immunol 1994 Jul 15;153(2):910]

Previous studies have suggested that gangliosides have an important role in cell signaling and recognition.

However, their specific function in these processes has not been clearly defined.

A mAb, R24, that reacts specifically with a cell surface ganglioside (GD3) has been demonstrated to stimulate proliferation of T cells derived from human peripheral blood.

In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms by which the R24 mAb affects T cell functions.

We have observed that the R24 mAb stimulates GD3+ T cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, and surface marker expression of IL-2R alpha-chain, IL-2R beta-chain, HLA-DR, CD11a, and CD11c.
# T1 Protein S6 119 130 797 808 IL-2R alpha
# T2 Protein S6 138 148 816 826 IL-2R beta
# T3 Protein S6 164 169 842 847 CD11a
# T4 Protein S6 175 180 853 858 CD11c

Additionally, IFN-gamma activity but not IL-1, IL-2, or IL-4 activity was present in culture supernatants 72 h after R24 stimulation.
# T5 Protein S7 14 23 874 883 IFN-gamma
# T6 Protein S7 47 51 907 911 IL-2
# T7 Protein S7 56 60 916 920 IL-4

In some donors, increased IL-6 and TNF-alpha activity also was detected after R24 treatment.
# T8 Protein S8 26 30 1020 1024 IL-6
# T9 Protein S8 35 44 1029 1038 TNF-alpha

Furthermore, R24 treatment resulted in translocation of c-rel, but little or no NF kappa B p50 or p65, from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and an increase of NF kappa B binding complexes containing c-rel and p50.
# T10 Protein S9 56 61 1143 1148 c-rel
# T11 Protein S9 91 94 1178 1181 p50
# T12 Protein S9 98 101 1185 1188 p65
# T13 Protein S9 196 201 1283 1288 c-rel
# T14 Protein S9 206 209 1293 1296 p50

This treatment also caused increased tyrosine phosphorylation of specific protein substrates.

R24-stimulated increases in proliferation, cytotoxicity, and cell surface protein expression could be blocked by cyclosporin and staurosporin, indicating that cyclophilin/calcineurin and protein kinase C may be involved in the R24 signaling pathway.

Additionally, herbimycin A, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked the R24-stimulated increase in proliferation but not cytotoxicity at concentrations consistent with specificity for tyrosine kinases.

These results suggest that multiple biochemical pathways are involved in the activation of human T cells by R24.
