Cutting edge: expression of the NF of activated T cells in eosinophils: regulation by IL-4 and IL-5.
# T1 Protein S1 86 90 86 90 IL-4
# T2 Protein S1 95 99 95 99 IL-5

We report that NF-AT1 and NF-AT4 are expressed cytoplasmically in resting eosinophils, whereas NF-AT2 and NF-AT3 have not been seen.
# T3 Protein S2 15 21 117 123 NF-AT1
# T4 Protein S2 26 32 128 134 NF-AT4
# T5 Protein S2 95 101 197 203 NF-AT2
# T6 Protein S2 106 112 208 214 NF-AT3

Likewise, NF-AT1 mRNA and NF-AT4 mRNA have been detected in resting eosinophils, and their levels can be significantly up-regulated by the Th2-associated cytokines IL-4 and IL-5.
# T7 Protein S3 10 16 245 251 NF-AT1
# T8 Protein S3 26 32 261 267 NF-AT4
# T9 Protein S3 164 168 399 403 IL-4
# T10 Protein S3 173 177 408 412 IL-5

There is no detectable NF-AT protein expression in the nuclei of resting eosinophils.

However NF-ATs appear in the nuclei of IL-4-, IL-5-, or ionomycin-stimulated eosinophils.
# T11 Protein S5 39 43 539 543 IL-4
# T12 Protein S5 46 50 546 550 IL-5

Only NF-AT1 and NF-AT4, but not NF-AT2 and NF-AT3, have translocated into the nuclei in IL-4- or IL-5-stimulated eosinophils.
# T13 Protein S6 5 11 595 601 NF-AT1
# T14 Protein S6 16 22 606 612 NF-AT4
# T15 Protein S6 32 38 622 628 NF-AT2
# T16 Protein S6 43 49 633 639 NF-AT3
# T17 Protein S6 88 92 678 682 IL-4
# T18 Protein S6 97 101 687 691 IL-5

These findings delineate a novel pathway in the cytokine network in which Th2 lymphocytes "control" eosinophils via the release of IL-4 and IL-5, and activation of NF-AT in eosinophils.
# T19 Protein S7 131 135 847 851 IL-4
# T20 Protein S7 140 144 856 860 IL-5

The findings also suggest that a later feedback "talking" may exist between eosinophils and Th2 lymphocytes.
