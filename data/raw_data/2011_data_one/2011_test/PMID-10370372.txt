C/EBP beta in rheumatoid arthritis: correlation with inflammation, not disease specificity.
# T1 Protein S1 0 10 0 10 C/EBP beta

Rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue was examined and compared with osteoarthritis tissue for the presence of the nuclear transcription factor C/EBP beta (NF-IL-6).
# T2 Protein S2 143 153 236 246 C/EBP beta
# T3 Protein S2 155 162 248 255 NF-IL-6

The region (lining or sublining), cell type, and subcellular distribution (cytoplasmic or nuclear) of the expression of C/EBP beta was characterized.

Rheumatoid arthritis synovial fluid and blood and normal peripheral blood were also examined.

C/EBP beta was detected in the synovial lining and in sublining cells of synovial tissue from patients with both rheumatoid and osteoarthritis.
# T4 Protein S5 0 10 502 512 C/EBP beta

A significant (P < 0.001 and < 0.05, respectively) increase in the percentage of cells with nuclear staining was seen in the lining layer, compared to cells in the sublining region, in rheumatoid and osteoarthritis.

In both diseases a strong correlation (r = 0.79, P < 0.001) was observed between the percentage of cells in the synovial lining that were positive for nuclear C/EBP beta and lining cell depth.
# T5 Protein S7 159 169 1021 1031 C/EBP beta

Two-color immunohistochemistry demonstrated that both macrophages and fibroblast-like synoviocytes were positive for nuclear C/EBP beta.
# T6 Protein S8 125 135 1180 1190 C/EBP beta

The presence of C/EBP beta was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis with isolated synovial fibroblasts.
# T7 Protein S9 16 26 1208 1218 C/EBP beta

Nuclear C/EBP beta was also detected in rheumatoid synovial fluid monocytes/macrophages, but not in lymphocytes or neutrophils.
# T8 Protein S10 8 18 1327 1337 C/EBP beta

Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of C/EBP beta in these cells.
# T9 Protein S11 48 58 1495 1505 C/EBP beta

The intensity of C/EBP beta staining was greater (P < 0.001) in synovial fluid monocytes than in those from normal or rheumatoid peripheral blood.
# T10 Protein S12 17 27 1539 1549 C/EBP beta

In conclusion, the enhanced nuclear staining for C/EBP beta in the synovial lining, compared to the sublining, suggesting activation in the lining, and the positive correlation of lining layer depth with the percentage of cells in the lining positive for nuclear C/EBP beta, suggest a potential role for C/EBP beta in chronic inflammation.

# T12 Protein S13 263 273 1932 1942 C/EBP beta
# T13 Protein S13 304 314 1973 1983 C/EBP beta

The regulation of the production or activity of C/EBP beta, to inhibit inflammatory mediator expression by synovial macrophages and fibroblasts, offers a novel approach to therapeutic intervention.
