Discussion

In this report, we show that Sox6 is a novel factor in the complicated regulation mechanism of globin genes.
# T1 Protein S2 29 33 40 44 Sox6

In the Sox6 null mouse, there is a transient effect on the embryonic globin genes, zeta and betaH1, and a persistent upregulation of the epsilony globin gene.
# T2 Protein S3 7 11 127 131 Sox6
# T3 Protein S3 59 81 179 201 embryonic globin genes
# T4 Protein S3 83 87 203 207 zeta
# T5 Protein S3 92 98 212 218 betaH1
# T6 Protein S3 137 152 257 272 epsilony globin

Sox6 directly regulates and binds to the proximal promoter of epsilony gene and represses the epsilony-globin gene in definitive erythropoiesis.
# T7 Protein S4 0 4 279 283 Sox6
# T8 Protein S4 62 75 341 354 epsilony gene
# T9 Protein S4 94 109 373 388 epsilony-globin

Sox6 belongs to group D of the Sox family of proteins that includes Sox5, 12, 13, and 23 [34].
# T10 Protein S5 0 4 425 429 Sox6
# T11 Protein S5 68 72 493 497 Sox5
# T12 Protein S5 74 76 499 501 12
# T13 Protein S5 78 80 503 505 13
# T14 Protein S5 86 88 511 513 23

Group D Sox proteins contain a coiled-coiled domain that mediates homo- and heterodimerization [6,35].

Functionally, dimerization of Sox5 and Sox6 has been shown to greatly increase the binding efficiency of the two Sox proteins to DNA that contains adjacent Sox sites [6].
# T15 Protein S7 30 34 653 657 Sox5
# T16 Protein S7 39 43 662 666 Sox6
# T17 Protein S7 109 125 732 748 two Sox proteins

In addition, Sox6 binds more strongly to an HMG-box dimer motif than to a single HMG-box motif [5].
# T18 Protein S8 13 17 807 811 Sox6

Therefore, it appears that target genes for group D Sox proteins, such as Sox6, probably harbor pairs of HMG binding sites with a configuration compatible with binding of D-Sox protein dimers.
# T19 Protein S9 74 78 968 972 Sox6

Indeed, in the present study, the defined Sox6 target sequence of the epsilony promoter contains two Sox/Sox6 consensus sites (Figure 3A).
# T20 Protein S10 42 46 1129 1133 Sox6
# T21 Protein S10 70 78 1157 1165 epsilony

Functionally, both sites are essential for Sox6 binding to the epsilony promoter and repression of its activity (Figure 3E and 3F).
# T22 Protein S11 43 47 1269 1273 Sox6
# T23 Protein S11 63 71 1289 1297 epsilony

These observations suggest that Sox6 binds to this sequence of the epsilony promoter either as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with other Sox proteins.
# T24 Protein S12 32 36 1390 1394 Sox6
# T25 Protein S12 67 75 1425 1433 epsilony

Because Sox proteins recognize a short 6-bp core-binding sequence that allows for considerable degeneracy, the specificity of their actions is thought to rely upon interactions with other transcription factors [36].

In our EMSAs, we had to run the electrophoresis on a 4%-6% gel for at least 4-8 h to detect the Sox6-associated band, suggesting that Sox6 is part of a high molecular weight complex.
# T26 Protein S14 96 100 1822 1826 Sox6
# T27 Protein S14 134 138 1860 1864 Sox6

A few other epsilony globin repressors have been reported to bind to DNA sequences near the Sox/Sox6 consensus sites, including the DRED complex [37] and COUP-TF [38].
# T28 Protein S15 12 27 1921 1936 epsilony globin
# T29 Protein S15 132 136 2041 2045 DRED
# T30 Protein S15 154 158 2063 2067 COUP
# T31 Protein S15 159 161 2068 2070 TF

Sox6 might interact with these factors and form a large repression complex.
# T32 Protein S16 0 4 2077 2081 Sox6
# T33 Protein S16 25 38 2102 2115 these factors

Identification of other components of the Sox6-containing complex associated with the epsilony promoter will shed light on its mechanism of repression.
# T34 Protein S17 42 46 2195 2199 Sox6
# T35 Protein S17 86 94 2239 2247 epsilony

Sox proteins bind and bend linear DNA by partial intercalation in the minor groove, and can also bind to four-way junctions [2-4].

Therefore, one attractive model to explain how Sox6 proteins control gene expression is that they function as architectural factors bound to DNA, influencing local chromatin structure by bending DNA and by assembling multiprotein transcriptional complexes.
# T36 Protein S19 47 51 2484 2488 Sox6

By changing the local chromatin structure, Sox6 could either interfere with binding of other activators to the promoter or facilitate binding of other repressors.
# T37 Protein S20 43 47 2737 2741 Sox6

Another example of a repressor that interferes with an activator on the epsilony promoter is DRED.
# T38 Protein S21 72 80 2929 2937 epsilony
# T39 Protein S21 93 97 2950 2954 DRED

DRED interferes with EKLF, an activator, in binding to the epsilony promoter [39].
# T40 Protein S22 0 4 2956 2960 DRED
# T41 Protein S22 21 25 2977 2981 EKLF
# T42 Protein S22 59 67 3015 3023 epsilony

Two HMG architectural proteins (distantly related to the Sox family of transcription factors), HMG-I and HMG-Y, were demonstrated to bind to the human adult beta globin silencers (silencers I and II) and cause bending of the DNA, facilitating the binding of other repressors [40].
# T43 Protein S23 95 100 3134 3139 HMG-I
# T44 Protein S23 105 110 3144 3149 HMG-Y
# T45 Protein S23 157 178 3196 3217 beta globin silencers
# T46 Protein S23 180 191 3219 3230 silencers I
# T47 Protein S23 196 198 3235 3237 II

Sox6 expression is temporally and spatially coincident with definitive (but not primitive) erythropoiesis (Figure 6), and Sox6 represses epsilony globin expression both in vivo (Figure 1) and in vitro (Figure 2).
# T48 Protein S24 0 4 3321 3325 Sox6
# T49 Protein S24 122 126 3443 3447 Sox6
# T50 Protein S24 137 152 3458 3473 epsilony globin

Moreover, in situ hybridization clearly shows that the persistent expression of epsilony globin in p100H mutant mice is due to defects in the silencing mechanism of definitive erythropoiesis that takes place in the liver (Figure 5).
# T51 Protein S25 80 95 3614 3629 epsilony globin

Taken together, these data demonstrate that Sox6 functions in definitive erythropoiesis to silence epsilony globin expression.
# T52 Protein S26 44 48 3811 3815 Sox6
# T53 Protein S26 99 114 3866 3881 epsilony globin

The expression level of epsilony globin in homozygous Sox6 null mice at 15.5 dpc and 18.5 dpc is statistically equivalent to the level of betamaj/min expression in the livers of 15.5-dpc and 18.5-dpc homozygous WT mice (Figure 1).
# T54 Protein S27 24 39 3919 3934 epsilony globin
# T55 Protein S27 54 58 3949 3953 Sox6
# T56 Protein S27 138 145 4033 4040 betamaj
# T57 Protein S27 146 149 4041 4044 min

This demonstrates that ectopic expression of the epsilony globin gene is quite robust in homozygous mutant mice.
# T58 Protein S28 49 64 4175 4190 epsilony globin

The expression levels of two other embryonic globin genes (zeta and betah1) are also higher in p100H homozygotes, compared with WT.
# T59 Protein S29 35 57 4274 4296 embryonic globin genes
# T60 Protein S29 59 63 4298 4302 zeta
# T61 Protein S29 68 74 4307 4313 betah1

Like epsilony, levels of zeta and betah1 are dramatically higher in mutant mice at 15.5 dpc.
# T62 Protein S30 5 13 4376 4384 epsilony
# T63 Protein S30 25 29 4396 4400 zeta
# T64 Protein S30 34 40 4405 4411 betah1

However, unlike epsilony globin, zeta and betah1 decline in expression by day 18.5 dpc (Figure 1), suggesting that epsilony is regulated differently than zeta and betah1.
# T65 Protein S31 16 31 4480 4495 epsilony globin
# T66 Protein S31 33 37 4497 4501 zeta
# T67 Protein S31 42 48 4506 4512 betah1
# T68 Protein S31 115 123 4579 4587 epsilony
# T69 Protein S31 154 158 4618 4622 zeta
# T70 Protein S31 163 169 4627 4633 betah1

It is possible that Sox6 has a general effect on embryonic globin genes (and erythrocyte maturation) in addition to a specific role in silencing epsilony.
# T71 Protein S32 20 24 4655 4659 Sox6
# T72 Protein S32 145 153 4780 4788 epsilony

Although most p100H mutant mice die just after being born, a rare few survive longer.

None have been observed to live longer than 2 wk after birth [14].

We examined a single archived sample of liver RNA from a mutant mouse on postnatal day 13.5 for globin gene expression and detected high levels of epsilony globin in this RNA sample, compared with undetectable epsilony RNA in WT control mice.
# T73 Protein S35 147 162 5091 5106 epsilony globin
# T74 Protein S35 210 218 5154 5162 epsilony

At this point in development, the levels of zeta and betah1 RNA were undetectable both in mutant and WT; however, adult beta-like globin RNA levels were moderately elevated in the mutant RNA compared with WT (unpublished data), similar to what we observe at 18.5 dpc (Figure 1).
# T75 Protein S36 44 48 5231 5235 zeta
# T76 Protein S36 53 59 5240 5246 betah1
# T77 Protein S36 120 136 5307 5323 beta-like globin

These findings suggest that Sox6 continues to function postnatally to silence epsilony globin expression and has a unique function in the regulation of epsilony-globin.
# T78 Protein S37 28 32 5494 5498 Sox6
# T79 Protein S37 78 93 5544 5559 epsilony globin
# T80 Protein S37 152 167 5618 5633 epsilony-globin

The mechanism by which Sox6 regulates the other embryonic globin genes remains to be elucidated.
# T81 Protein S38 23 27 5658 5662 Sox6

Sox6 has other effects in erythropoiesis, including a delay in enucleation/maturation in p100H mutant mice.
# T82 Protein S39 0 4 5733 5737 Sox6

This may be the result of indirect effects, such as stress-induced proliferation (resulting from cardiac defects) and/or anemia.

Severe anemia can lead to rapid premature release of red cells, prior to their complete maturation.

However, the hematocrit of 18.5-dpc mutant mice is only 20% lower than that of WT (unpublished data), and this mild anemia is probably not sufficient to explain the extent of nucleated red cells.

Alternatively, Sox6 itself may play a role in red cell terminal differentiation, as it has been shown to be an important factor in cardiac [15], neuronal [10], astrocytic [11], and cartilage differentiation programs [32,41-44].
# T83 Protein S43 15 19 6281 6285 Sox6

The restoration of normal enucleation of red cells in Sox6-deficient mouse by postnatal day 10.5 may result from functional compensation of other Sox proteins (expressed at later developmental stages), since functional redundancy is a recurring theme with Sox proteins [13,45,46].
# T84 Protein S44 54 58 6549 6553 Sox6

Moreover, erythropoiesis has already shifted from fetal liver to bone marrow by postnatal day 10.5.

The accompanying change in the microenvironment of red cell production may permit normal enucleation.

Identification of Sox6 downstream target genes and its interacting proteins will shed light on the role of Sox6 in red cell terminal differentiation and the enucleation process.
# T85 Protein S47 18 22 6996 7000 Sox6
# T86 Protein S47 107 111 7085 7089 Sox6

Recently, in vivo and in vitro analyses suggest that reactivation of human epsilon-globin would be therapeutically beneficial to adults with sickle cell disease [47], providing a rationale for detailed investigations into the molecular basis of epsilon-globin gene silencing.
# T87 Protein S48 75 89 7232 7246 epsilon-globin
# T88 Protein S48 245 259 7402 7416 epsilon-globin

The present study identifies a novel repressor, Sox6, which binds to the epsilony proximal promoter, potentially as part of a larger repression complex.
# T89 Protein S49 48 52 7481 7485 Sox6
# T90 Protein S49 73 81 7506 7514 epsilony

Because murine Sox6 and its human counterpart are 94% identical at the amino acid level [48], it is possible that human Sox6 may also be important in human epsilon globin silencing.
# T91 Protein S50 15 19 7601 7605 Sox6
# T92 Protein S50 120 124 7706 7710 Sox6
# T93 Protein S50 156 170 7742 7756 epsilon globin

There is significant sequence homology between the human and mouse epsilon promoter regions, and the human promoter contains at least two potential Sox6 binding sites.
# T94 Protein S51 67 74 7835 7842 epsilon

Indeed, the existence of a silencer of the human epsilon globin gene has been proposed [49,50].
# T95 Protein S52 49 63 7985 7999 epsilon globin

Thus, elucidation of the Sox6 repression mechanism and identification of other components of the Sox6-containing complex may further our understanding of epsilon globin regulation and potentially reveal additional molecular targets for the treatment of sickle cell anemia and beta thalassemias.
