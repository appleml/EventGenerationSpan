GP modulated TSST-1-induced DNA binding to a new NFATP2/3 site in the IL-1RA promoter.
# T1 Protein S1 13 19 13 19 TSST-1
# T2 Protein S1 70 76 70 76 IL-1RA

Binding was up-regulated for GP + LPS and GP + TSST-1, when compared to GP and, in the latter case, to both GP and TSST-1 (* = p < 0.05).
# T3 Protein S2 47 53 134 140 TSST-1
# T4 Protein S2 115 121 202 208 TSST-1

Human PBMC were incubated with medium control, LPS, TSST-1, GP, GP + TSST-1 and GP + LPS for 1 h at 37degreesC.
# T5 Protein S3 52 58 277 283 TSST-1
# T6 Protein S3 69 75 294 300 TSST-1

Schematic representation of the elevated NFAT-DNA binding activity to the site in the IL-1RA promoter.
# T7 Protein S4 41 45 378 382 NFAT
# T8 Protein S4 86 92 423 429 IL-1RA

Bars depicting the theoretical values for GP/LPS calc. and GP/TSST-1 calc. are added.
# T9 Protein S6 62 68 502 508 TSST-1

Medium control levels were set equal to 1 +/- SEM (n = 6).

An autoradiogram of a representative experiment is shown in the lower panel (lane 1: water; lane 2: medium control; lane 3: GP; lane 4: LPS; lane 5: TSST-1, lane 6: GP + LPS; lane 7: GP + TSST-1).
# T10 Protein S9 149 155 734 740 TSST-1
# T11 Protein S9 188 194 773 779 TSST-1
