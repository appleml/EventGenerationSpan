Age-related decreases in IL-2 production by human T cells are associated with impaired activation of nuclear transcriptional factors AP-1 and NF-AT.
# T1 Protein S1 25 29 25 29 IL-2

Although transcriptional factors AP-1 and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) are important for the normal induction of IL-2, it is unknown if the age-related decline in IL-2 production by activated human T cells may be associated with aberrancies in transcriptional regulatory proteins.

# T3 Protein S2 178 182 328 332 IL-2

In the current studies, IL-2 production by T cells from elderly (mean 78 years) and young (mean 37 years) humans was measured in cultures stimulated with PHA, PHA plus PMA, crosslinked anti-CD3 mAB OKT3 plus PMA, or PMA plus ionomycin.
# T4 Protein S3 24 28 470 474 IL-2
# T5 Protein S3 154 157 600 603 PHA
# T6 Protein S3 159 162 605 608 PHA

Substantial decreases of IL-2 production were observed for cell cultures from 7 of 12 elderly individuals in response to the different stimuli, whereas the levels of IL-2 produced by stimulated T cells from other elderly individuals were equivalent to those observed for stimulated T cells of young subjects.
# T7 Protein S4 25 29 707 711 IL-2
# T8 Protein S4 166 170 848 852 IL-2

Analyses of nuclear extracts by electrophoretic DNA mobility shift assays showed that decreased IL-2 production by stimulated T cells of elderly individuals was closely associated with impairments in the activation of both AP-1 and NF-AT.
# T9 Protein S5 96 100 1087 1091 IL-2

By contrast, T cells from elderly subjects with normal levels of IL-2 production exhibited normal activation of AP-1 and NF-AT.
# T10 Protein S6 65 69 1295 1299 IL-2

In addition, the results of competition experiments analyzing the normal components of NF-AT showed that the age-related reductions in stimulus-dependent NF-AT complexes corresponded to the slow migrating complexes that were composed of c-Fos/c-Jun AP-1.
# T11 Protein S7 237 242 1595 1600 c-Fos
# T12 Protein S7 243 248 1601 1606 c-Jun

The resting and stimulated levels of NF kappa B were reduced in T cells from certain elderly individuals; however, alterations of NF kappa B did not correlate with changes in IL-2 expression.
# T13 Protein S8 175 179 1788 1792 IL-2

Thus, these results show that age-related impairments in the activation of AP-1 and NF-AT are closely associated with decreased expression of IL-2 and further suggest that aberrancies in the signaling pathways important for the induction of transcriptionally active c-Fos/c-Jun AP-1 may contribute to the impaired activation of NF-AT.
