Protein kinase B (c-Akt), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and STAT5 are activated by erythropoietin (EPO) in HCD57 erythroid cells but are constitutively active in an EPO-independent, apoptosis-resistant subclone (HCD57-SREI cells).
# T1 Protein S1 0 16 0 16 Protein kinase B
# T2 Protein S1 18 23 18 23 c-Akt
# T3 Protein S1 61 66 61 66 STAT5
# T4 Protein S1 84 98 84 98 erythropoietin

# T6 Protein S1 166 169 166 169 EPO

We found that erythropoietin (EPO) and stem cell factor (SCF) activated protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) in EPO-dependent HCD57 erythroid cells.
# T7 Protein S2 14 28 247 261 erythropoietin
# T8 Protein S2 30 33 263 266 EPO
# T9 Protein S2 39 55 272 288 stem cell factor
# T10 Protein S2 57 60 290 293 SCF
# T11 Protein S2 72 88 305 321 protein kinase B
# T12 Protein S2 90 93 323 326 PKB
# T13 Protein S2 94 97 327 330 Akt
# T14 Protein S2 102 105 335 338 EPO

To better understand signals controlling proliferation and viability, erythroid cells that resist apoptosis in the absence of EPO were subcloned and characterized (HCD57-SREI cells).
# T15 Protein S3 126 129 498 501 EPO

Constitutive activations of PKB/Akt, STAT5a, and STAT5b were noted in these EPO-independent cells.
# T16 Protein S4 28 31 583 586 PKB
# T17 Protein S4 32 35 587 590 Akt
# T18 Protein S4 37 43 592 598 STAT5a
# T19 Protein S4 49 55 604 610 STAT5b
# T20 Protein S4 76 79 631 634 EPO

PI3-kinase activity was an upstream activator of PKB/Akt because the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 blocked both constitutive PKB/Akt and factor-dependent PKB/Akt activity.
# T21 Protein S5 49 52 703 706 PKB
# T22 Protein S5 53 56 707 710 Akt
# T23 Protein S5 125 128 779 782 PKB
# T24 Protein S5 129 132 783 786 Akt
# T25 Protein S5 154 157 808 811 PKB
# T26 Protein S5 158 161 812 815 Akt

The LY294002 study showed that proliferation and viability of both HCD57-SREI and HCD57 cells correlated with the activity of PKB/Akt; however, PKB/Akt activity alone did not protect these cells from apoptosis.
# T27 Protein S6 126 129 952 955 PKB
# T28 Protein S6 130 133 956 959 Akt
# T29 Protein S6 144 147 970 973 PKB
# T30 Protein S6 148 151 974 977 Akt

Treatment of HCD57 cells with SCF also activated PKB/Akt, but did not protect from apoptosis.
# T31 Protein S7 30 33 1067 1070 SCF
# T32 Protein S7 49 52 1086 1089 PKB
# T33 Protein S7 53 56 1090 1093 Akt

This result suggested that PKB/PI3-kinase activity is necessary but not sufficient to promote viability and/or proliferation.
# T34 Protein S8 27 30 1158 1161 PKB

Constitutive STAT5 activity, activated through an unknown pathway not including JAK2 or EPOR, may act in concert with the constitutive PI3-kinase/PKB/Akt pathway to protect the EPO-independent HCD57-SREI cells from apoptosis and promote limited proliferation.
