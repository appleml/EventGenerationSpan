Resistance to IL-10 inhibition of interferon gamma production and expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 in CD4+ T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis
# T1 Protein S1 14 19 14 19 IL-10
# T2 Protein S1 34 50 34 50 interferon gamma
# T3 Protein S1 80 114 80 114 suppressor of cytokine signaling 1
# T4 Protein S1 118 121 118 121 CD4

IL-10 has been shown to block the antigen-specific T-cell cytokine response by inhibiting the CD28 signaling pathway.

# T6 Protein S2 94 98 266 270 CD28

We found that peripheral blood CD4+ T cells from patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were able to produce greater amounts of interferon gamma after CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10 than were normal control CD4+ T cells, although their surface expression of the type 1 IL-10 receptor was increased.
# T7 Protein S3 31 34 321 324 CD4
# T8 Protein S3 136 152 426 442 interferon gamma
# T9 Protein S3 167 171 457 461 CD28
# T10 Protein S3 213 218 503 508 IL-10
# T11 Protein S3 244 247 534 537 CD4
# T12 Protein S3 299 320 589 610 type 1 IL-10 receptor

The phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 was sustained in both blood and synovial tissue CD4+ T cells of RA, but it was not augmented by the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10.
# T13 Protein S4 23 73 649 699 signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
# T14 Protein S4 122 125 748 751 CD4
# T15 Protein S4 194 199 820 825 IL-10

Sera from RA patients induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation in normal CD4+ T cells, which was mostly abolished by neutralizing anti-IL-6 antibody.
# T16 Protein S5 30 80 857 907 signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
# T17 Protein S5 107 110 934 937 CD4
# T18 Protein S5 169 173 996 1000 IL-6

Preincubation of normal CD4+ T cells with IL-6 reduced IL-10-mediated inhibition of interferon gamma production.
# T19 Protein S6 24 27 1035 1038 CD4
# T20 Protein S6 42 46 1053 1057 IL-6
# T21 Protein S6 55 60 1066 1071 IL-10
# T22 Protein S6 84 100 1095 1111 interferon gamma

Blood CD4+ T cells from RA patients contained higher levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 but lower levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 mRNA compared with control CD4+ T cells, as determined by real-time PCR.
# T23 Protein S7 6 9 1130 1133 CD4
# T24 Protein S7 63 97 1187 1221 suppressor of cytokine signaling 1
# T25 Protein S7 118 152 1242 1276 suppressor of cytokine signaling 3
# T26 Protein S7 180 183 1304 1307 CD4

These results indicate that RA CD4+ T cells become resistant to the immunosuppressive effect of IL-10 before migration into synovial tissue, and this impaired IL-10 signaling may be associated with sustained signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 induction.
