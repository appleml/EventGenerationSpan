CD4+ T cells orchestrate the Th1-type cell-mediated immune response in RA [22].
# T1 Protein S1 0 3 0 3 CD4

Activated CD4+ T cells stimulate macrophages, synovial fibroblasts, B cells, and osteoclasts through the expression of cell surface molecules and Th1 cytokines, thereby contributing to both the chronic inflammation and the joint destruction.
# T2 Protein S2 10 13 90 93 CD4

CD4+ T cells require two signals to be activated; antigen receptor occupancy and CD28-mediated costimulation.
# T3 Protein S3 0 3 322 325 CD4
# T4 Protein S3 81 85 403 407 CD28

In the ST lesion, the CD28 ligands, both CD80 and CD86, together with MHC class II antigens, are substantially expressed by antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells [18-20].
# T5 Protein S4 22 26 454 458 CD28
# T6 Protein S4 41 45 473 477 CD80
# T7 Protein S4 50 54 482 486 CD86

The significance of CD28 engagement in the T-cell-mediated disease process has recently been proven by the clinical efficacy of its blocker cytotoxic T-cell-associated antigen 4 (CD152)-IgG in RA patients [23].
# T8 Protein S5 20 24 650 654 CD28
# T9 Protein S5 140 189 770 819 cytotoxic T-cell-associated antigen 4 (CD152)-IgG

IL-10 plays a predominant role in limiting immune and inflammatory responses by regulating the function of both macrophages and Th1 cells [1].
# T10 Protein S6 0 5 842 847 IL-10

IL-10 inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD28 molecule and the subsequent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase binding in T cells, and thereby directly acts on T cells [24].
# T11 Protein S7 0 5 985 990 IL-10
# T12 Protein S7 51 55 1036 1040 CD28

In the present study, we found that PB CD4+ T cells from patients with active RA, in the presence of IL-10, are able to produce higher levels of IFN-gamma after CD3 and CD28 costimulation than normal CD4+ T cells.

# T17 Protein S8 200 203 1362 1365 CD4

Despite high-level IL-10R1 expression and constitutive STAT3 activation, IL-10-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is suppressed in RA CD4+ T cells, in contrast to normal CD4+ T cells, where STAT3 phosphorylation is dose-dependently inducible by IL-10.

# T25 Protein S9 252 257 1628 1633 IL-10

Serum IL-6 from RA patients induces STAT3 but not STAT1 phosphorylation in normal CD4+ T cells, and exogenous IL-6 induces the resistance to IL-10 inhibition of IFN-gamma production.

# T32 Protein S10 161 170 1796 1805 IFN-gamma

RA CD4+ T cells contain higher levels of SOCS1 but contain lower levels of SOCS3 transcripts in comparison with normal CD4+ T cells.
# T33 Protein S11 3 6 1821 1824 CD4
# T34 Protein S11 41 46 1859 1864 SOCS1
# T35 Protein S11 75 80 1893 1898 SOCS3
# T36 Protein S11 119 122 1937 1940 CD4

These findings indicate that CD4+ T cells become resistant to the inhibitory effect of IL-10 before migration into the inflamed ST, and suggest that this resistance may be attributable to impaired IL-10-dependent STAT3 activation, in association with sustained STAT3 phosphorylation and SOCS1 induction.

IL-10-mediated inhibition of CD4+ T-cell cytokine production is principally dependent on its inhibition of macrophage antigen-presenting cell function [1].
# T43 Protein S13 0 5 2256 2261 IL-10
# T44 Protein S13 29 32 2285 2288 CD4
# T45 Protein S13 89 92 2345 2348 its

However, this indirect inhibitory effect is thought to be restricted at the site of T-cell activation in RA, because macrophages in the ST express high levels of cytokines, CD80 and CD86 molecules, and MHC class II antigens [10,18-20].
# T46 Protein S14 173 177 2585 2589 CD80
# T47 Protein S14 182 186 2594 2598 CD86

More recently, IL-10 has been shown to induce the antigen-specific T-cell unresponsiveness by inhibiting CD28 tyrosine phosphorylation [33].
# T48 Protein S15 15 20 2663 2668 IL-10
# T49 Protein S15 105 109 2753 2757 CD28

This direct effect also may be limited in active RA patients, because their PB CD4+ T cells showed a defective IL-10 inhibition of CD28-costimulated production of both IFN-gamma and IL-2.
