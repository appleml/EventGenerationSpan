Culture of CD4+ T cells
# T1 Protein S1 11 14 11 14 CD4

PB CD4+ T-cell populations were resuspended at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml in culture medium with 10% FCS, and 0.5 ml cell suspensions were dispensed into the wells of 24-well microtiter plates (Coster) coated with 1 mug/ml anti-CD3 mAb (Immunotech, Marseille, France).
# T2 Protein S2 3 6 27 30 CD4

The cells were incubated with 1 mug/ml anti-CD28 mAb (Immunotech) in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of IL-10 (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) at 37degreesC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 [28].
# T3 Protein S3 44 48 340 344 CD28
# T4 Protein S3 128 133 424 429 IL-10

Culture supernatants were collected 36 hours later and cell-free samples were stored at -30degreesC until cytokine assay.

To examine the effect of IL-6 on T-cell responsiveness to IL-10, CD4+ T cells from healthy controls were incubated in culture medium with 10% FCS in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml IL-6 (Becton Dickinson) for 36 hours.
# T5 Protein S5 25 29 681 685 IL-6
# T6 Protein S5 58 63 714 719 IL-10
# T7 Protein S5 65 68 721 724 CD4
# T8 Protein S5 185 189 841 845 IL-6

Cells were then stimulated for 36 hours with anti-CD3 mAb and anti-CD28 mAb in the presence or absence of 1 ng/ml IL-10.
# T9 Protein S6 67 71 946 950 CD28
# T10 Protein S6 114 119 993 998 IL-10

Culture supernatants were measured for IFN-gamma concentrations.
# T11 Protein S7 39 48 1039 1048 IFN-gamma
