CD14-mediated signal pathway of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide in human gingival fibroblasts.
# T1 Protein S1 0 4 0 4 CD14

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces expression of inflammatory cytokines in monocytes/macrophages via CD14, one of the LPS receptors, which is expressed predominantly in these cells.
# T2 Protein S2 99 103 207 211 CD14

It has been demonstrated that Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS (P-LPS) also is able to induce inflammatory cytokines in human gingival fibroblasts.

Therefore, it is important to determine whether CD14 is expressed in gingival fibroblasts and to define the P-LPS-mediated signal-transducing mechanism in the cells.

In this study, we observed unexpectedly by immunohistochemical, Western blotting (immunoblotting), and Northern (RNA) blotting assays that CD14 is expressed at high density in human gingival fibroblasts.
# T4 Protein S5 139 143 737 741 CD14

P-LPS-induced expression of the monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) gene in the cells was inhibited markedly by treatment with anti-human CD14 antibody and was completely inhibited by herbimycin A, a potent inhibitor of tyrosine kinase.
# T5 Protein S6 32 66 834 868 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1
# T6 Protein S6 68 73 870 875 MCP-1
# T7 Protein S6 145 149 947 951 CD14

The inhibitor also dramatically inhibited monocyte chemotactic activity of and MCP-1 production by the cells.
# T8 Protein S7 79 84 1125 1130 MCP-1

Furthermore, P-LPS-induced expression of the MCP-1 gene in the cells also was blocked by inhibitors of two transcription factors, i.e., curcumin, an inhibitor of AP-1, and pyrolidine dithiocarbamate, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB.
# T9 Protein S8 45 50 1201 1206 MCP-1

Both inhibitors inhibited monocyte chemotactic activity in the culture supernatant of P-LPS-treated cells.

Gel shift mobility assay showed stimulation of the AP-1 and NF-kappaB contents in P-LPS-treated cells.

This study is the first to demonstrate the expression of CD14 in human gingival fibroblasts and to show that the signal-transducing pathway of P-LPS in the cells is mediated by CD14.
