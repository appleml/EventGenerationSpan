Differential inhibition of Smad6 and Smad7 on bone morphogenetic protein- and activin-mediated growth arrest and apoptosis in B cells.
# T1 Protein S1 27 32 27 32 Smad6
# T2 Protein S1 37 42 37 42 Smad7

Smad6 and Smad7 prevent ligand-induced activation of signal-transducing Smad proteins in the transforming growth factor-beta family.
# T3 Protein S2 0 5 136 141 Smad6
# T4 Protein S2 10 15 146 151 Smad7

Here we demonstrate that both Smad6 and Smad7 are human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (hBMP-2)-inducible antagonists of hBMP-2-induced growth arrest and apoptosis in mouse B cell hybridoma HS-72 cells.
# T5 Protein S3 30 35 299 304 Smad6
# T6 Protein S3 40 45 309 314 Smad7
# T7 Protein S3 50 84 319 353 human bone morphogenetic protein-2
# T8 Protein S3 86 92 355 361 hBMP-2
# T9 Protein S3 119 125 388 394 hBMP-2

Moreover, we confirmed that the ectopic expressions of Smad6 and Smad7 inhibited the hBMP-2-induced Smad1/Smad5 phosphorylation.
# T10 Protein S4 55 60 525 530 Smad6
# T11 Protein S4 65 70 535 540 Smad7
# T12 Protein S4 85 91 555 561 hBMP-2
# T13 Protein S4 100 105 570 575 Smad1
# T14 Protein S4 106 111 576 581 Smad5

We previously reported that Smad7 is an activin A-inducible antagonist of activin A-induced growth arrest and apoptosis in HS-72 cells.
# T15 Protein S5 28 33 627 632 Smad7
# T16 Protein S5 40 49 639 648 activin A
# T17 Protein S5 74 83 673 682 activin A

Interestingly, although mRNA expression of Smad6 was induced by activin A in HS-72 cells, Smad6 showed no antagonistic effect on activin A-induced growth arrest and apoptosis.
# T18 Protein S6 43 48 778 783 Smad6
# T19 Protein S6 64 73 799 808 activin A
# T20 Protein S6 90 95 825 830 Smad6
# T21 Protein S6 129 138 864 873 activin A

Moreover, we found that the ectopic expression of Smad7, but not Smad6, inhibited the activin A-induced Smad2 phosphorylation in HS-72 cells.
# T22 Protein S7 50 55 961 966 Smad7
# T23 Protein S7 65 70 976 981 Smad6
# T24 Protein S7 86 95 997 1006 activin A
# T25 Protein S7 104 109 1015 1020 Smad2

Thus, Smad6 and Smad7 exhibit differential inhibitory effects in bone morphogenetic protein-2- and activin A-mediated signaling in B lineage cells.
# T26 Protein S8 6 11 1059 1064 Smad6
# T27 Protein S8 16 21 1069 1074 Smad7
# T28 Protein S8 65 93 1118 1146 bone morphogenetic protein-2
# T29 Protein S8 99 108 1152 1161 activin A
