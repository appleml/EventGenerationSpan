Association of the interleukin-4 receptor alpha chain with p47phox, an activator of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase in B cells.

Interleukin (IL)-4 plays an important role in IgE synthesis in B cells and in Th2 differentiation in T cells.
# T3 Protein S2 0 18 125 143 Interleukin (IL)-4

IL-4 conducts its biological activities through binding to the IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) on the surface of target cells.
# T4 Protein S3 0 4 235 239 IL-4

IL-4R are thought to be composed of the IL-4R alpha chain (IL-4R alpha) and either the IL-2R gamma chain or the IL-13R alpha chain.

We have previously shown that the membrane-proximal portion in the cytoplasmic domain of the human IL-4R alpha (hIL-4R alpha) is critical for proliferation, generation of germline epsilon transcript, and activation of STAT6, based on analyses of truncated hIL-4R alphas.

# T10 Protein S5 112 124 596 608 hIL-4R alpha
# T11 Protein S5 218 223 702 707 STAT6
# T12 Protein S5 256 268 740 752 hIL-4R alpha

In this study, we found that p47phox, an activator of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, binds to this portion by the two-hybrid system.
# T13 Protein S6 29 36 784 791 p47phox

Furthermore, we observed the association of p47phox with the hIL-4R alpha in B cells derived from a normal donor.
# T14 Protein S7 44 51 930 937 p47phox
# T15 Protein S7 61 73 947 959 hIL-4R alpha

These results suggest that p47phox is involved in the signal transduction of IL-4 in B cells.
# T16 Protein S8 27 34 1027 1034 p47phox
# T17 Protein S8 77 81 1077 1081 IL-4

However, activation of STAT6, CD23 expression, and IgE synthesis induced by IL-4 were not affected in p47phox-deficient patients, which raises the possibility that p47phox may be important in other signaling activities as well in B cells.
