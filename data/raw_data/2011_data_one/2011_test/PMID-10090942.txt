Human immunodeficiency virus-associated Hodgkin's disease derives from post-germinal center B cells.

Human immunodeficiency virus-associated Hodgkin's disease (HIV-HD) displays several peculiarities when compared with HD of the general population.

These include overrepresentation of clinically aggressive histologic types and frequent infection of Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

Recently, we have reported that the histogenesis of HD of the general population may be assessed by monitoring the expression pattern of BCL-6, a transcription factor expressed in germinal center (GC) B cells, and of CD138/syndecan-1 (syn-1), a proteoglycan associated with post-GC, terminal B-cell differentiation.
# T1 Protein S4 137 142 542 547 BCL-6
# T2 Protein S4 217 222 622 627 CD138
# T3 Protein S4 223 233 628 638 syndecan-1
# T4 Protein S4 235 240 640 645 syn-1

In this study, we have applied these two markers to the study of HIV-HD histogenesis and correlated their expression status to the virologic features of this disease.

We have found that RS cells of all histologic categories of HIV-HD consistently display the BCL-6(-)/syn-1(+) phenotype and thus reflect post-GC B cells.
# T5 Protein S6 92 97 980 985 BCL-6
# T6 Protein S6 101 106 989 994 syn-1

Although BCL-6(-)/syn-1(+)RS cells of HIV-HD express CD40, they are not surrounded by CD40 ligand-positive (CD40L+) reactive T lymphocytes, which, in HD of the general population, are thought to regulate the disease phenotype through CD40/CD40L interactions.
# T7 Protein S7 9 14 1051 1056 BCL-6
# T8 Protein S7 18 23 1060 1065 syn-1
# T9 Protein S7 53 57 1095 1099 CD40
# T10 Protein S7 86 97 1128 1139 CD40 ligand
# T11 Protein S7 108 113 1150 1155 CD40L
# T12 Protein S7 234 238 1276 1280 CD40
# T13 Protein S7 239 244 1281 1286 CD40L

Conversely, RS cells of virtually all HIV-HD express the EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), which, being functionally homologous to CD40, may contribute, at least in part, to the modulation of the HIV-HD phenotype.
# T14 Protein S8 69 94 1370 1395 latent membrane protein 1
# T15 Protein S8 96 100 1397 1401 LMP1
# T16 Protein S8 143 147 1444 1448 CD40
