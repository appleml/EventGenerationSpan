To identify the molecular basis for specificity and inducibility, the chromatin configuration of the human B7.1 gene was examined in intact nuclei from various cell types.

The identification of a tissue-specific deoxyribonuclease I hypersensitive site approximately 3kb upstream of the transcription start site led to the characterization of a cell type-specific enhancer region.

This 183-bp region was both cell type specific and responsive to two distinct stimuli, lipopolysaccharide and dibutyryl cAMP, known to regulate B7.1 expression.

Deletional and site-directed mutagenesis revealed the presence of multiple functionally critical cis elements within this region, one of which was a nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB consensus sequence.

In B7.1-positive B cells, this element bound several members of the NF-kappaB family, transcription factors already implicated in signal transduction pathways relevant to B7.1 expression.

This is the first description, to our knowledge, of regulatory elements that control expression of a gene encoding a B7 costimulatory molecule.
