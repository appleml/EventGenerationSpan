Induction requirements in primary human T cells.

Prior studies have identified several elements that contribute to the activity of the IL-2 promoter in the stimulated T cell line, Jurkat.

The sites and their corresponding nuclear binding factors include: NF-kappa B, AP-1, AP-3, OCT-1, and NF-AT.
# T3 Protein S4 91 96 354 359 OCT-1

The latter "nuclear factor for activated T cells" likely contributes to the tissue specificity of IL-2 gene expression.

Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we have studied these transcription factors in primary T cells from human blood to verify their presence in a physiologic setting and to identify the signals that stimulate factor activity.

All factors are induced in the nuclei of T cells upon activation with mitogens but not with exogenous IL-2 growth factor.

However, the signaling requirements and sensitivity to protein synthesis inhibitors differ considerably.

% E9 Positive_regulation:T17 Theme:T3

Only the activities for NF-AT and AP-1 sites require two signals for optimal induction, i.e., PMA plus either lectin or antibody to the CD3 or CD28 surface molecules.
# T6 Protein S9 143 147 1097 1101 CD28

Other factors are induced by lectin, antibody, and/or PMA alone.
@ T18 Positive_regulation S10 18 25 1139 1146 induced
% E10 Positive_regulation:T18 Theme:T3

After appropriate stimulation, both NF-AT and AP-1 are peculiarly sensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin.

Our data correlate the activity of NF-AT and AP-1 in gel shift assays with the two signals requirements for IL-2 gene expression.
