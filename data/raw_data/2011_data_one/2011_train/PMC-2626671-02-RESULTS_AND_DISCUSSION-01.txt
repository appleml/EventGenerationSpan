A cell culture system to monitor effector CTL differentiation

We used a simple cell culture system to examine the kinetics of effector gene expression during CD8+ T cell differentiation.
# T1 Protein S2 96 99 158 161 CD8

Naive CD8+ T cells from P14 TCR transgenic mice were activated for 2 d with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 or with splenic APCs in the presence of Gp33 peptide, and were cultured in media containing 100 U/ml of recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2).
# T2 Protein S3 6 9 193 196 CD8
# T3 Protein S3 81 84 268 271 CD3
# T4 Protein S3 94 98 281 285 CD28
# T5 Protein S3 221 225 408 412 IL-2
# T6 Protein S3 227 233 414 420 rhIL-2

We used TCR transgenic mice for these experiments because they provide a reliable source of CD8+ T cells that are truly naive; however, we chose not to stimulate cells with antigen in most experiments so as to avoid contamination with proteins and nucleic acids derived from APCs.
# T7 Protein S4 92 95 515 518 CD8

There were only minor differences in gene expression during differentiation induced by antigen/APC versus anti-CD3/anti-CD28, and the major conclusions presented in this report are the same for both activating conditions.
# T8 Protein S5 111 114 815 818 CD3
# T9 Protein S5 120 124 824 828 CD28

Under our culture conditions, activated CD8+ T cells expanded exponentially and accumulated for >8 d.
# T10 Protein S6 40 43 967 970 CD8

We limited our analysis to the first 6-8 d after activation, a period that coincides with clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells after activation in vivo.
