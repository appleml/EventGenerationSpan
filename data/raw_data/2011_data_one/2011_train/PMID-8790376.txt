Activation of Stat 5b in erythroid progenitors correlates with the ability of ErbB to induce sustained cell proliferation.

Self renewal of normal erythroid progenitors is induced by the receptor tyrosine kinase c-ErbB, whereas other receptors (c-Kit/Epo-R) regulate erythroid differentiation.
# T2 Protein S2 121 126 245 250 c-Kit
# T3 Protein S2 127 132 251 256 Epo-R

To address possible mechanisms that could explain this selective activity of c-ErbB, we analyzed the ability of these receptors to activate the different members of the Stat transcription factor family.

Ligand activation of c-ErbB induced the tyrosine phosphorylation, DNA-binding, and reporter gene transcription of Stat 5b in erythroblasts.

In contrast, ligand activation of c-Kit was unable to induce any of these effects in the same cells.

Activation of the erythropoietin receptor caused specific DNA-binding of Stat 5b, but failed to induce reporter gene transcription.

These biochemical findings correlate perfectly with the selective ability of c-ErbB to cause sustained self renewal in erythroid progenitors.
