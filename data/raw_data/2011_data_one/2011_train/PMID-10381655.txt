NF-kappaB functions as both a proapoptotic and antiapoptotic regulatory factor within a single cell type.

Recently NF-kappaB has been shown to have both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic functions.

In T cell hybridomas, both T cell activators and glucocorticoids induce apoptosis.

Here we show that blockade of NF-kappaB activity, using a dominant negative IkappaBalpha, has opposite effects on these two apoptotic signals.
# T1 Protein S4 76 88 355 367 IkappaBalpha

Treatment with PMA plus ionomycin (P/I) results in the upregulation of Fas Ligand (FasL) and induction of apoptosis.
# T2 Protein S5 71 81 493 503 Fas Ligand
# T3 Protein S5 83 87 505 509 FasL
$ T3 Protein S5 83 87 505 509 FasL
@ T5 Positive_regulation S5 55 67 477 489 upregulation
% E1 Positive_regulation:T5 Theme:T3

Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity inhibits the P/I mediated induction of FasL mRNA and decreases the level of apoptosis in these cultures, thus establishing NF-kappaB as a proapoptotic factor in this context.
# T4 Protein S6 72 76 611 615 FasL
$ T4 Protein S6 72 76 611 615 FasL
@ T6 Negative_regulation S6 33 41 572 580 inhibits
@ T7 Positive_regulation S6 50 58 589 597 mediated
@ T8 Transcription S6 59 68 598 607 induction
% E2 Negative_regulation:T6 Theme:E4
% E3 Positive_regulation:T7 Theme:E4
% E4 Transcription:T8 Theme:T4

Conversely, inhibition of NF-kappaB confers a tenfold increase in glucocorticoid mediated apoptosis, establishing that NF-kappaB also functions as an antiapoptotic factor.

We conclude that NF-kappaB is a context-dependent apoptosis regulator.

Our data suggests that NF-kappaB may function as an antiapoptotic factor in thymocytes while functioning as a proapoptotic factor in mature peripheral T cells.
