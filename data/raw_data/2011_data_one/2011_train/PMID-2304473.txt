The ubiquitous octamer-binding protein(s) is sufficient for transcription of immunoglobulin genes.

All immunoglobulin genes contain a conserved octanucleotide promoter element, ATGCAAAT, which has been shown to be required for their normal B-cell-specific transcription.

Proteins that bind this octamer have been purified, and cDNAs encoding octamer-binding proteins have been cloned.

Some of these proteins (referred to as OTF-2) are lymphoid specific, whereas at least one other, and possibly more (referred to as OTF-1), is found ubiquitously in all cell types.
# T1 Protein S4 39 44 425 430 OTF-2
# T2 Protein S4 131 136 517 522 OTF-1

The exact role of these different proteins in directing the tissue-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes is unclear.

We have identified two human pre-B-cell lines that contain extremely low levels of OTF-2 yet still express high levels of steady-state immunoglobulin heavy-chain mRNA in vivo and efficiently transcribe an immunoglobulin gene in vitro.
# T3 Protein S6 83 88 772 777 OTF-2

Addition of a highly enriched preparation of OTF-1 made from one of these pre-B cells or from HeLa cells specifically stimulated in vitro transcription of an immunoglobulin gene.

Furthermore, OFT-1 appeared to have approximately the same transactivation ability as OTF-2 when normalized for binding activity.

These results suggest that OTF-1, without OTF-2, is sufficient for transcription of immunoglobulin genes and that OTF-2 alone is not responsible for the B-cell-specific regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression.
