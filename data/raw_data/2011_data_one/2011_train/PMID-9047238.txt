The possible clinical use of the methyl xanthine derivative, pentoxifylline (PF), for the treatment of T cell-dependent diseases is being noted with increasing interest.

In this paper, we studied the molecular consequences of PF treatment during lymphocyte activation.

We found that in T cells, anti-CD3-induced c-Rel expression was blocked by PF, whereas the induction of other NF-kappaB family members was not significantly affected.

However, induction of NF-AT, which has the same signaling requirements as c-Rel induction, was not inhibited by PF.

Among genes that respond to these transcription factors, IL-2 mRNA induction was suppressed by PF, whereas IL-2R(alpha) chain mRNA induction was not affected.

These observations implicated c-Rel as an IL-2 promoter factor, for which experimental support was obtained from transient transfection experiments.

In contrast with the observation in T cells, c-Rel induction was not blocked by PF in B cells.

The greater selectivity of PF, compared with FK506, at both the molecular and cellular levels may prove advantageous in manipulating T cell responses in vivo.
