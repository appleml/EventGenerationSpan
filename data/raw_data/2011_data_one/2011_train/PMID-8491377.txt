Cloning and functional characterization of early B-cell factor, a regulator of lymphocyte-specific gene expression.
# T1 Protein S1 43 62 43 62 early B-cell factor

Early B-cell factor (EBF) was identified previously as a tissue-specific and differentiation stage-specific DNA-binding protein that participates in the regulation of the pre-B and B lymphocyte-specific mb-1 gene.

Partial amino acid sequences obtained from purified EBF were used to isolate cDNA clones, which by multiple criteria encode EBF.
# T5 Protein S3 52 55 383 386 EBF
# T6 Protein S3 124 127 455 458 EBF

The recombinant polypeptide formed sequence-specific complexes with the EBF-binding site in the mb-1 promoter.

# T8 Protein S4 96 100 556 560 mb-1

The cDNA hybridized to multiple transcripts in pre-B and B-cell lines, but transcripts were not detected at significant levels in plasmacytoma, T-cell, and nonlymphoid cell lines.

Expression of recombinant EBF in transfected nonlymphoid cells strongly activated transcription from reporter plasmids containing functional EBF-binding sites.

# T10 Protein S6 141 144 892 895 EBF

Analysis of DNA binding by deletion mutants of EBF identified an amino-terminal cysteine-rich DNA-binding domain lacking obvious sequence similarity to known transcription factors.
# T11 Protein S7 47 50 958 961 EBF

DNA-binding assays with cotranslated wild-type and truncated forms of EBF indicated that the protein interacts with its site as a homodimer.

Deletions delineated a carboxy-terminal dimerization region containing two repeats of 15 amino acids that show similarity with the dimerization domains of basic-helix-loop-helix proteins.

Together, these data suggest that EBF represents a novel regulator of B lymphocyte-specific gene expression.
