Nitric oxide-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange on p21ras.
# T1 Protein S1 55 61 55 61 p21ras

The protooncogene p21ras, a monomeric G protein family member, plays a critical role in converting extracellular signals into intracellular biochemical events.
# T2 Protein S2 18 24 82 88 p21ras

Here, we report that nitric oxide (NO) activates p21ras in human T cells as evidenced by an increase in GTP-bound p21ras.

In vitro studies using pure recombinant p21ras demonstrate that the activation is direct and reversible.
# T5 Protein S4 40 46 386 392 p21ras

Circular dichroism analysis reveals that NO induces a profound conformational change in p21ras in association with GDP/GTP exchange.
# T6 Protein S5 88 94 539 545 p21ras

The mechanism of activation is due to S-nitrosylation of a critical cysteine residue which stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that p21ras is essential for NO-induced downstream signaling, such as NF-kappa B activation, and that endogenous NO can activate p21ras in the same cell.

These studies identify p21ras as a target of the same cell.
# T9 Protein S8 23 29 920 926 p21ras

These studies identify p21ras as a target of NO in T cells and suggest that NO activates p21ras by an action which mimics that of guanine nucleotide exchange factors.
