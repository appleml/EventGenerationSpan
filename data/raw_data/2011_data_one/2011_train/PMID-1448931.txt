Natural variants of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat: analysis of promoters with duplicated DNA regulatory motifs.

Sequence variation in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region of HIV-1 was analyzed in viral isolates of 17 infected individuals.

Two classes of LTR size variants were found.

One HIV-1 variant was detected containing an additional binding site for the transcription factor Sp1.
# T1 Protein S4 98 101 385 388 Sp1

Another LTR size variation was observed in four patients in a region just upstream of the NF-kappa B enhancer.

This variation was the result of a duplication of a short DNA sequence (CTG-motif).

Cell culture experiments demonstrated that the natural variant with four Sp1 sites had a slightly higher promoter activity and viral replication rate than the isogenic control LTR with three Sp1 sites.
# T2 Protein S7 73 76 658 661 Sp1
# T3 Protein S7 191 194 776 779 Sp1

No positive effect of the duplicated CTG-motif could be detected.

In order to measure small differences in virus production more accurately, equal amounts of a size variant and the wild-type plasmid were cotransfected into T-cells.

The virus with four Sp1 sites did outgrow the three Sp1 virus in 35 days of culture and CTG-monomer virus outcompeted the CTG-dimer virus in 42 days.
# T4 Protein S10 20 23 1039 1042 Sp1
# T5 Protein S10 52 55 1071 1074 Sp1

Based on these results we estimate a 5-10% difference in virus production of the LTR variants when compared to that of wild-type.
