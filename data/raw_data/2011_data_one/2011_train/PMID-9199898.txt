S-allyl cysteine inhibits activation of nuclear factor kappa B in human T cells.

Reactive oxygen species are involved in signal transduction pathways leading to nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation which has been implicated in the regulation of gene transcription.

We recently reported that a garlic compound, S-allyl cysteine (SAC), protects bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells from oxidant injury induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).

In this study we determined the effects of SAC on NF-kappa B activation in human T lymphocytes (Jurkat cells) induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- alpha) and H2O2.
# T1 Protein S4 121 148 574 601 tumor necrosis factor alpha
# T2 Protein S4 150 160 603 613 TNF- alpha

Activated NF-kappa B in nuclear extracts was measured by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using 32P-labeled probe.

SAC consistently exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of NF-kappa B activation induced by both TNF-alpha and H2O2.
# T3 Protein S6 96 105 843 852 TNF-alpha

Supershift with specific antibodies to NF-kappa B subunits confirmed that the inducible retarded bands observed in the EMSA and p65-p50 heterodimer of the NF-kappa B/Rel protein.
# T4 Protein S7 128 131 991 994 p65
# T5 Protein S7 132 135 995 998 p50

@ T6 Binding S7 136 147 999 1010 heterodimer

Our data suggest that SAC may act via antioxidant mechanisms to block NF-kappa B activation in Jurkat cells.
