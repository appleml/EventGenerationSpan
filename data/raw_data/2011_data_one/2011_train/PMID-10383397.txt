3-deazaadenosine, a S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor, has dual effects on NF-kappaB regulation.

Previously we reported that 3-deazaadenosine (DZA), a potent inhibitor and substrate for S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibits bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced transcription of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta in mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells.

In this study, we demonstrate the effects of DZA on nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) regulation.

DZA inhibits the transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB through the hindrance of p65 (Rel-A) phosphorylation without reduction of its nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity.

The inhibitory effect of DZA on NF-kappaB transcriptional activity is potentiated by the addition of homocysteine.

Taken together, DZA promotes the proteolytic degradation of IkappaBalpha, but not IkappaBbeta, resulting in an increase of DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB in the nucleus in the absence of its transcriptional activity in RAW 264.7 cells.

The reduction of IkappaBalpha by DZA is neither involved in IkappaB kinase complex activation nor modulated by the addition of homocysteine.

This study strongly suggests that DZA may be a potent drug for the treatment of diseases in which NF-kappaB plays a central pathogenic role, as well as a useful tool for studying the regulation and physiological functions of NF-kappaB.
