T lymphocytes express several low molecular weight transmembrane adaptor proteins that recruit src homology (SH)2 domain-containing intracellular molecules to the cell membrane via tyrosine-based signaling motifs.

We describe here a novel molecule of this group termed SIT (SHP2 interacting transmembrane adaptor protein).
# T3 Protein S3 55 58 391 394 SIT
# T4 Protein S3 60 106 396 442 SHP2 interacting transmembrane adaptor protein

SIT is a disulfide-linked homodimeric glycoprotein that is expressed in lymphocytes.

After tyrosine phosphorylation by src and possibly syk protein tyrosine kinases SIT recruits the SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 via an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif.

Overexpression of SIT in Jurkat cells downmodulates T cell receptor- and phytohemagglutinin-mediated activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) by interfering with signaling processes that are probably located upstream of activation of phospholipase C. However, binding of SHP2 to SIT is not required for inhibition of NF-AT induction, suggesting that SIT not only regulates NF-AT activity but also controls NF-AT unrelated pathways of T cell activation involving SHP2.
