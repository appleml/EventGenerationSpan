The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1 is a major regulator of gene expression in erythroid, megakaryocyte, and mast cell lineages.
# T2 Protein S2 37 43 146 152 GATA-1

GATA-1 binds to WGATAR consensus motifs in the regulatory regions of virtually all erythroid cell-specific genes.

Analyses with cultured cells and cell-free systems have provided strong evidence that GATA-1 is involved in control of globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation.
# T4 Protein S4 86 92 446 452 GATA-1

Targeted mutagenesis of the GATA-1 gene in embryonic stem cells has demonstrated its requirement in normal erythroid development.
# T5 Protein S5 28 34 564 570 GATA-1

Efficient rescue of the defect requires an intact GATA element in the distal promoter, suggesting autoregulatory control of GATA-1 transcription.

To examine whether GATA-1 expression involves additional regulatory factors or is maintained entirely by an autoregulatory loop, we have used a transient heterokaryon system to test the ability of erythroid factors to activate the GATA-1 gene in nonerythroid nuclei.

We show here that proerythroblasts and mature erythroid cells contain a diffusible activity (TAG) capable of transcriptional activation of GATA-1 and that this activity decreases during the terminal differentiation of erythroid cells.

Nuclei from GATA-1- mutant embryonic stem cells can still be reprogrammed to express their globin genes in erythroid heterokaryons, indicating that de novo induction of GATA-1 is not required for globin gene activation following cell fusion.
