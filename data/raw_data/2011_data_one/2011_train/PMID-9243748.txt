Induction of nuclear factor kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes by anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibodies.

Monoclonal antibodies against either monomorphic or polymorphic determinants of class I antigen induced in PBMC and highly purified T lymphocytes the nuclear activity of NF-kappa B/Rel complexes.

These included both p50/p50 and p50/p65 dimers, recognized by specific antibodies in EMSA.

The induced complexes were detectable in extracts of cells incubated with anti-class I monoclonal antibody (mAb) for 1.5 h; the induction was maximal at 5 h, persistent at 16 h and no longer observed at 40 h.

The mAb failed to induce NF-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in cells incubated in the presence of 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, an inhibitor of I kappa B-alpha degradation.

Together, these results suggest that class I triggering can induce the activity of NF-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in peripheral blood T lymphocytes, thereby modulating the expression of genes regulated by these transcription factors.
