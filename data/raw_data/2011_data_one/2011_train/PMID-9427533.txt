Competent transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II in cell-free extracts from xeroderma pigmentosum groups B and D in an optimized RNA transcription assay.

The human autosomal recessive disease, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), can result from mutations in any one of seven genes, designated XPA through XPG.
# T1 Protein S2 131 134 293 296 XPA
# T2 Protein S2 143 146 305 308 XPG

Of these, the XPB and XPD genes encode proteins that are subunits of a general transcription factor, TFIIH, involved in both nucleotide excision repair (NER) and initiation of mRNA transcription by RNA polymerase II.
# T3 Protein S3 14 17 324 327 XPB
# T4 Protein S3 22 25 332 335 XPD

In humans, mutation of the XPB or XPD gene impairs NER, resulting in hyper-sensitivity to sunlight and greatly increased skin tumor formation.
# T5 Protein S4 27 30 554 557 XPB
# T6 Protein S4 34 37 561 564 XPD

However, no transcription deficiency has been demonstrated in either XP-B or XP-D.
# T7 Protein S5 69 73 739 743 XP-B
# T8 Protein S5 77 81 747 751 XP-D

We have employed an optimized cell-free RNA transcription assay to analyze transcription activity of XP-B and XP-D.
# T9 Protein S6 101 105 854 858 XP-B
# T10 Protein S6 110 114 863 867 XP-D

Although the growth rate was normal, the XP-B and XP-D cells contained reduced amounts of TFIIH.
# T11 Protein S7 41 45 910 914 XP-B
# T12 Protein S7 50 54 919 923 XP-D

Extracts prepared from XP-B and XP-D lymphoblastoid cells exhibited similar transcription activity from the adenovirus major late promoter when compared to that in extracts from normal cells.
# T13 Protein S8 23 27 989 993 XP-B
# T14 Protein S8 32 36 998 1002 XP-D

Thus, we conclude that the XP-B and XP-D lymphoblastoid cells do not have impaired RNA transcription activity.
# T15 Protein S9 27 31 1185 1189 XP-B
# T16 Protein S9 36 40 1194 1198 XP-D

We consider the possible consequences of the reduced cellular content of TFIIH for the clinical symptoms in XP-B or XP-D patients, and discuss a 'conditional phenotype' that may involve an impairment of cellular function only under certain growth conditions.
# T17 Protein S10 108 112 1377 1381 XP-B
# T18 Protein S10 116 120 1385 1389 XP-D
