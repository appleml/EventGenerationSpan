Mapping of the transcriptional repression domain of the lymphoid-specific transcription factor oct-2A.
# T1 Protein S1 95 101 95 101 oct-2A

The lymphoid-specific transcription factor Oct-2a is implicated in B cell-specific transcriptional activity via the octamer motif.
# T2 Protein S2 43 49 147 153 Oct-2a

Structure/function analysis of various Oct-2a effector regions in the context of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain revealed that Oct-2a contains two functionally different activation domains at the N and the C termini.

@ T10 Entity S3 192 193 427 428 N

The transcriptional activity of both domains is strongly potentiated by interactions with distinct B cell-specific coactivators.

Recently, we have identified a repression domain located within the N terminus of Oct-2a (amino acids 2-99).
# T6 Protein S5 82 88 659 665 Oct-2a

When this domain was transferred to a potent activator, transcription was strongly inhibited.

In this study we present a deletion analysis of the N-terminal region of Oct-2a to determine the minimal repression domain.
# T7 Protein S7 73 79 853 859 Oct-2a

We identified a stretch of 23 amino acids, rich in serine and threonine residues, which was responsible for most of the repression activity.

We show that repression is strongly dependent on the type of enhancer present in the reporter plasmid as well as on the cell line tested.

The possibility that Oct-2a can act as an activator and/or a repressor may have important consequences for the function of Oct-2a in B cell differentiation and other developmental processes.
