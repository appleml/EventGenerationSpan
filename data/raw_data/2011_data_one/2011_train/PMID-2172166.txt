Characterization of defensin resistance phenotypes associated with mutations in the phoP virulence regulon of Salmonella typhimurium.

The defensin sensitivities of Salmonella typhimurium strains with mutations in the phoP/phoQ two-component virulence regulon were tested by using purified defensins NP-1 and NP-2.
# T1 Protein S2 83 87 218 222 phoP
# T2 Protein S2 88 92 223 227 phoQ
# T3 Protein S2 165 169 300 304 NP-1
# T4 Protein S2 174 178 309 313 NP-2

Strains with mutations in either gene of the regulatory pair (phoP [transcriptional activator] or phoQ [membrane sensor kinase]) had increased sensitivities to defensin.
# T5 Protein S3 62 66 377 381 phoP
# T6 Protein S3 98 102 413 417 phoQ

The predicted periplasmic domain of the PhoQ protein contained a markedly anionic domain that could interact with cationic proteins and that could be responsible for resistance to defensin.
# T7 Protein S4 40 44 525 529 PhoQ

Because insertion mutations in phoP are polar on phoQ, we constructed strains that expressed the PhoQ protein in the absence of PhoP to test whether resistance to defensin requires only the phoQ gene product.
# T8 Protein S5 31 35 706 710 phoP
# T9 Protein S5 49 53 724 728 phoQ
# T10 Protein S5 97 101 772 776 PhoQ
# T11 Protein S5 128 132 803 807 PhoP
# T12 Protein S5 190 194 865 869 phoQ

We found that resistance to defensin requires the function of both components of this regulatory system, because strains expressing PhoQ without PhoP were still markedly sensitive to defensins.
# T13 Protein S6 132 136 1016 1020 PhoQ
# T14 Protein S6 145 149 1029 1033 PhoP

This implied that a pag (phoP-activated gene) product is responsible for defensin resistance.

We also tested for the ability of defensins NP-1, NP-5, and HNP-1 to activate pag expression and found that these peptides have no effect.
# T15 Protein S8 44 48 1216 1220 NP-1
# T16 Protein S8 50 54 1222 1226 NP-5
# T17 Protein S8 60 65 1232 1237 HNP-1

Defensin resistance is not the only virulence characteristic controlled by the PhoP-PhoQ regulon because mutations in pagC, as well as ones in the phoP locus that resulted in constitutive pag activation (phenotype PhoPc), had no effect on defensin resistance, even though they rendered the organism avirulent and deficient in survival within macrophages.
# T18 Protein S9 79 83 1390 1394 PhoP
# T19 Protein S9 84 88 1395 1399 PhoQ
# T20 Protein S9 118 122 1429 1433 pagC
# T21 Protein S9 147 151 1458 1462 phoP

The virulence defect conferred by mutations in the phoP-phoQ two-component regulatory system is not completely explained by alterations in resistance to cationic proteins and involves the control of other proteins necessary for S. typhimurium survival within macrophages.

# T23 Protein S10 56 60 1722 1726 phoQ
