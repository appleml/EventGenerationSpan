IL-4 secreted by activated T cells is a pleiotropic cytokine affecting growth and differentiation of diverse cell types such as T cells, B cells, and mast cells.

We investigated the upstream regulatory elements of the human IL-4 promoter.
# T3 Protein S3 62 66 306 310 IL-4

A novel T cell-specific negative regulatory element (NRE) composed of two protein-binding sites were mapped in the 5' flanking region of the IL-4 gene: -311CTCCCTTCT-303 (NRE-I) and -288CTTTTTGCTT-TGC-300 (NRE-II).

A T cell-specific protein Neg-1 and a ubiquitous protein Neg-2 binding to NRE-I and NRE-II, respectively, were identified.

Furthermore, a positive regulatory element was found 45 bp downstream of the NRE.

The enhancer activity of the PRE was completely suppressed when the NRE was present.

These data suggest that IL-4 promoter activity is normally down-regulated by an NRE via repression of the enhancer positive regulatory element.

These data may have implications for the stringent control of IL-4 expression in T cells.
