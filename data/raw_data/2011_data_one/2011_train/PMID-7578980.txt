IFN-gamma priming of monocytes enhances LPS-induced TNF production by augmenting both transcription and MRNA stability.
# T1 Protein S1 0 9 0 9 IFN-gamma

The induction of cytokine expression in monocytes/macrophages by bacterial endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide is a critical, highly regulated host defence response.

The augmentation of LPS responses by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), referred to as priming, is well established.
# T2 Protein S3 37 53 320 336 interferon gamma
# T3 Protein S3 55 64 338 347 IFN-gamma

However, the mechanism(s) by which priming occurs is poorly defined.

Using tumour necrosis factor (TNF) induction as a model, experiments were designed to analyse in detail the priming effect on the LPS response in human monocytes.

Priming by IFN-gamma was primarily manifested at the level of TNF mRNA accumulation.
# T4 Protein S6 11 20 638 647 IFN-gamma

IFN-gamma pre-treatment affected the magnitude rather than the sensitivity of the LPS response.
# T5 Protein S7 0 9 712 721 IFN-gamma

Priming occurred after several hours of treatment, and the primed state was induced by either IFN-gamma or GM-CSF, but not M-CSF.
# T6 Protein S8 94 103 902 911 IFN-gamma
# T7 Protein S8 107 113 915 921 GM-CSF
# T8 Protein S8 123 128 931 936 M-CSF

Primed monocytes transcribed TNF mRNA at a higher rate than freshly isolated monocytes upon activation with LPS.

The increased transcriptional rate correlated with a marked increase in nuclear factor-kappa B activity in these cells as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a consensus NF-kappa B oligonucleotide.

An additional significant finding was than TNF mRNA induced in primed cells was much more stable than in unprimed cells (T1/2 increased 6-8-fold).

Consistent with the increased mRNA stability, the duration of mRNA accumulation was longer following LPS stimulation in primed monocytes, in addition to being of greater magnitude.

Finally, primed and unprimed cells possessed a differential sensitivity to the kinase inhibitor H-89.

H-89 substantially suppressed LPS-induced TNF mRNA accumulation in unprimed cells, but had no effect on primed monocytes following LPS stimulation.
