The role of BSAP (Pax-5) in B-cell development.

The hierarchy of transcriptional control in B-cell development has recently been analyzed by targeted gene inactivation in the mouse.

In this manner, the paired box containing gene Pax-5, encoding the B cell specific transcription factor BSAP, has been shown to play a key role in early B lymphopoiesis.
# T3 Protein S3 47 52 230 235 Pax-5
# T4 Protein S3 67 103 250 286 B cell specific transcription factor
# T5 Protein S3 104 108 287 291 BSAP

Other experimental strategies have implicated BSAP in the control of cell proliferation, isotype switching and transcription of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene at late stages of B-cell differentiation.
