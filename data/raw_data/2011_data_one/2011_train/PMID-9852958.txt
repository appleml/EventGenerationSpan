Here we report the expression of a fork head domain protein in human T helper cells.

We cloned and characterized a fork head cDNA from human T helper cell mRNA using differential display RT-PCR.

The cDNA contains a 546-nucleotide (nt) open reading frame (ORF) that codes for the carboxyl-terminal 180 amino acids (aa) of the recently identified fkhrl1 gene.
# T2 Protein S4 150 156 465 471 fkhrl1

This ORF does not contain the characteristic DNA-binding domain found in members of the forkhead protein family.

In-vitro transcription/translation of this cDNA expressed a protein of approximately 20 kDa.

We have generated antibodies that specifically immunoprecipitated the in-vitro-translated 20-kDa protein.

This antibody also recognizes in human T lymphocytes a 70-kDa protein corresponding in size to that predicted for the fkhrl1 gene product.

The mRNA levels for fkhrl1 is elevated in T helper-induced lymphocytes in comparison to PHA-stimulated T lymphocytes.

Further characterization of FKHRL1 and its related family members should shed light on the transcriptional mechanisms of this fork head gene subfamily and their role in T helper cell differentiation and regulation of cell growth.
