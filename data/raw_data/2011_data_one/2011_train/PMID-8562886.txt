The effect of Toremifene on the expression of some genes in human mononuclear cells.

Toremifene exerts multiple and varied effects on the gene expression of human peripheral mononuclear cells.

After short-term, in vitro exposure to therapeutical levels, distinct changes in P-glycoprotein, steroid receptors, p53 and Bcl-2 expression take place.
