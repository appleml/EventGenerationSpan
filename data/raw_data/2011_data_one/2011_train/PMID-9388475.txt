Molecular cloning and functional characterization of murine cDNA encoding transcription factor NFATc.
# T1 Protein S1 95 100 95 100 NFATc

Transcription factors of the NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) family play important roles in immune and inflammatory responses by regulating the expression of genes encoding cytokines and immunoregulatory proteins.

Here we describe cloning and characterization of full-length cDNA encoding murine (m) NFATc which predicts that the protein has all the conserved structural motifs of NFAT family members, including the rel homology domain, the NFAT homology domain and the nuclear translocation signals.

mNFATc complexed with AP-1 bound specifically to the murine IL-2 NFAT recognition sequence and activated transcription from the co-transfected IL-2 promoter in COS-7 cells.

Northern blot analysis showed that the cDNA probe hybridized with a 4.5 kb transcript which is highly inducible in murine T cells.

By Northern and in situ hybridization, mNFATc transcript was detected from the early stage of development.

In the mouse embryo, mNFATc transcript was strongly expressed in thymus, lung and submandibular gland and weakly in skeletal muscle and heart suggesting that mNFATc may have a role both in embryogenesis and in mature T cells.
