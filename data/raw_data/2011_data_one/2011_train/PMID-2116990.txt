Tandem AP-1-binding sites within the human beta-globin dominant control region function as an inducible enhancer in erythroid cells.
# T1 Protein S1 43 54 43 54 beta-globin

A powerful enhancer has been mapped to an 18-bp DNA segment located 11 kb 5' to the human epsilon-globin gene within the dominant control or locus-activating region.
# T2 Protein S2 90 104 224 238 epsilon-globin

This enhancer is inducible in K562 human erythroleukemia cells, increasing linked gamma-globin promoter/luciferase gene expression to 170-fold over an enhancerless construct.
# T3 Protein S3 82 94 382 394 gamma-globin
# T4 Protein S3 104 114 404 414 luciferase

The enhancer consists of tandem AP-1-binding sites, phased 10 bp apart, which are both required for full activity.

DNA-protein binding assays with nuclear extracts from induced cells demonstrate a high molecular weight complex on the enhancer.

The formation of this complex also requires both AP-1 sites and correlates with maximal enhancer activity.

Induction of the enhancer may have a role in the increase in globin gene transcription that characterizes erythroid maturation.

Enhancer activity appears to be mediated by the binding of a complex of proteins from the jun and fos families to tandem AP-1 consensus sequences.
