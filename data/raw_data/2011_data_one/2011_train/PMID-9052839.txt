TRAMP, a novel apoptosis-mediating receptor with sequence homology to tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 and Fas(Apo-1/CD95).

A novel member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, designated TRAMP, has been identified.
# T6 Protein S2 78 83 203 208 TRAMP

The structural organization of the 393 amino acid long human TRAMP is most homologous to TNF receptor 1.
# T7 Protein S3 61 66 292 297 TRAMP
# T8 Protein S3 89 103 320 334 TNF receptor 1

TRAMP is abundantly expressed on thymocytes and lymphocytes.

Its extracellular domain is composed of four cysteine-rich domains, and the cytoplasmic region contains a death domain known to signal apoptosis.

Overexpression of TRAMP leads to two major responses, NF-kappaB activation and apoptosis.

TRAMP-induced cell death is inhibited by an inhibitor of ICE-like proteases, but not by Bcl-2.
# T11 Protein S7 0 5 633 638 TRAMP

In addition, TRAMP does not appear to interact with any of the known apoptosis-inducing ligands of the TNF family.
