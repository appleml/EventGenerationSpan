Real-Time Quantitative RT-PCR

Cells were harvested and restimulated in the presence of immobilized anti-CD3 (2 mug/ml) plus anti-CD28 (2 mug/ml) for 3 hr or immediately lysed.
# T1 Protein S2 74 77 104 107 CD3
# T2 Protein S2 99 103 129 133 CD28

RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed and cDNA was analyzed for the expression of cytokines and transcription factors by real-time PCR assay as before (Shoemaker etal., 2006).

Target gene mRNA expression was quantified either with SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) or with Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and normalized to ubiquitin or HPRT mRNA levels, respectively.
# T3 Protein S4 145 154 501 510 ubiquitin
# T4 Protein S4 158 162 514 518 HPRT
$ T3 Protein S4 145 154 501 510 ubiquitin
