Involvement of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases in the signal transduction pathway for interleukin-1.
# T1 Protein S1 91 104 91 104 interleukin-1

Expression of a highly specific protein inhibitor for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases in interleukin-1 (IL-1)-responsive cells blocked IL-1-induced gene transcription that was driven by the kappa immunoglobulin enhancer or the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat.
# T2 Protein S2 94 107 201 214 interleukin-1
# T3 Protein S2 109 113 216 220 IL-1
# T4 Protein S2 140 144 247 251 IL-1
# T5 Protein S2 195 215 302 322 kappa immunoglobulin

This inhibitor did not affect protein kinase C-mediated gene transcription, suggesting that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases are involved in the signal transduction pathway for IL-1 in a number of responsive cell types.
# T6 Protein S3 181 185 571 575 IL-1
