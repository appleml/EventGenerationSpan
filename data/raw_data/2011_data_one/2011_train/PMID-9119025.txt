Cell-to-cell contact activates the long terminal repeat of human immunodeficiency virus 1 through its kappaB motif.

Cell-to-cell contact between peripheral blood lymphocytes and transfected human colonic carcinoma cell line HT29 activates transcription of the long terminal repeats (LTR) of human immunodeficiency virus.

HIV-1 LTR transcription is controlled by a complex array of virus-encoded and cellular proteins.

Using various constructs expressing a lacZ reporter gene under the control of the intact or three deleted forms of HIV-1 LTR, we obtained evidence that the kappaB regulatory elements located in the U3 region are involved in cell-to-cell activation of HIV-1 LTR.

Cell-to-cell contact activates in vitro binding of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p50/p65 heterodimer to an HIV-1 kappaB oligonucleotide.

Cell-to-cell contact activation of NF-kappaB was only partially inhibited by 100 microM pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and was not correlated with a significant decrease of cellular inhibitor kappaB alpha.

NF-kappaB nuclear activation was not detectable before 1 h after cell contact and was dependent on protein synthesis.
