Stimulation of HIV replication in mononuclear phagocytes by leukemia inhibitory factor.
# T1 Protein S1 60 86 60 86 leukemia inhibitory factor

This study examined the effects of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in mononuclear phagocytes (MNP).
# T2 Protein S2 35 61 124 150 leukemia inhibitory factor
# T3 Protein S2 63 66 152 155 LIF

LIF induced a dose-dependent increase in p24 antigen production in the chronically infected promonocytic cell line U1.
# T4 Protein S3 0 3 240 243 LIF
# T5 Protein S3 41 52 281 292 p24 antigen

The magnitude and time kinetics of the LIF effects were similar to interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), other cytokines known to induce HIV replication in this cell line.
# T6 Protein S4 39 42 398 401 LIF
# T7 Protein S4 89 93 448 452 IL-6

To characterize mechanisms responsible for these LIF effects, levels of HIV mRNA, activation of the DNA binding protein nuclear factor (NF)-kB, signal transduction pathways, and potential interactions with other cytokines were analyzed.
# T8 Protein S5 49 52 603 606 LIF

LIF increased steady-state levels of HIV mRNA at 2.0, 4.3, and 9.2 kB.
# T9 Protein S6 0 3 791 794 LIF

This was detectable by 24 h and persisted until 72 h.

The DNA binding protein NF-kB is a central mediator in cytokine activation of HIV transcription.

NF-kB levels were higher in unstimulated U1 cells as compared to the parent cell line U937.

In both cell lines LIF increased NF-kB activity.
# T10 Protein S10 19 22 1124 1127 LIF

Induction of NF-kB and HIV replication by cytokines are at least in part dependent on reactive oxygen intermediates.

The oxygen radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine, but not an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, inhibited LIF-induced HIV replication.
# T11 Protein S12 107 110 1378 1381 LIF

LIF induces the production of other cytokines in monocytes but its effects on HIV replication were not inhibited by antibodies to IL-1, TNF, or IL-6.
# T12 Protein S13 0 3 1407 1410 LIF
# T13 Protein S13 144 148 1551 1555 IL-6

These results identify LIF as a stimulus of HIV replication.
# T14 Protein S14 23 26 1580 1583 LIF
