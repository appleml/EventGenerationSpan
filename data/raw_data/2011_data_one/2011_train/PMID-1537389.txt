Interleukin 6-induced differentiation of a human B cell line into IgM-secreting plasma cells is mediated by c-fos.

The role of the protooncogene c-fos in interleukin (IL) 6-induced B cell differentiation was assessed.
# T3 Protein S2 30 35 146 151 c-fos
# T4 Protein S2 39 57 155 173 interleukin (IL) 6

Treatment of SKW 6.4 cells with IL 6 induced a transient and early stimulation of c-fos sense mRNA expression.

The addition of antisense oligonucleotides to c-fos significantly inhibited IL 6-induced IgM production by SKW 6.4 cells (p less than 0.001), whereas control oligonucleotides had no inhibitory effect.

# T8 Protein S5 76 80 480 484 IL 6

These results indicate that activation of c-fos is involved in IL 6-induced differentiation of SKW 6.4 cells into IgM-secreting cells.
