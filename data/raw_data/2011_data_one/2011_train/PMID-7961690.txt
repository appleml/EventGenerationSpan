Erythropoietin-dependent induction of hemoglobin synthesis in a cytokine-dependent cell line M-TAT.
# T1 Protein S1 0 14 0 14 Erythropoietin

M-TAT is a cytokine-dependent cell line with the potential to differentiate along the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages.

We cultured M-TAT cells long term (> 1 year) in the continuous presence of erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or stem cell factor (SCF).

# T6 Protein S3 159 175 385 401 stem cell factor
# T7 Protein S3 177 180 403 406 SCF

These long term cultures are referred to as M-TAT/EPO, M-TAT/GM-CSF, and M-TAT/SCF cells, respectively.

Hemoglobin concentration and gamma-globin and erythroid delta-aminolevulinate synthase mRNA levels were significantly higher in M-TAT/EPO cells than in M-TAT/GM-CSF cells.

When the supplemented cytokine was switched from GM-CSF to EPO, hemoglobin synthesis in M-TAT/GM-CSF cells increased rapidly (within 5 h), and the level of GATA-1 mRNA increased.

In contrast, the addition of GM-CSF to the M-TAT/EPO cell culture decreased the amount of hemoglobin, even in the presence of EPO, indicating that the EPO signal for erythroid differentiation is suppressed by GM-CSF.
# T15 Protein S7 29 35 893 899 GM-CSF
# T16 Protein S7 49 52 913 916 EPO
# T17 Protein S7 126 129 990 993 EPO
# T18 Protein S7 151 154 1015 1018 EPO
# T19 Protein S7 209 215 1073 1079 GM-CSF

Thus, erythroid development of M-TAT cells is promoted by EPO and suppressed by GM-CSF.
# T20 Protein S8 58 61 1139 1142 EPO
# T21 Protein S8 80 86 1161 1167 GM-CSF

These results support the hypothesis that EPO actively influences the programming of gene expression required for erythroid progenitor cell differentiation.
