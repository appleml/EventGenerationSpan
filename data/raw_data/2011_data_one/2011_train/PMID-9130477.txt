Regulation of human epsilon germline transcription: role of B-cell-specific activator protein.
# T1 Protein S1 60 93 60 93 B-cell-specific activator protein

Germline transcripts initiate from promoters upstream of the immunoglobulin switch region, and are necessary to target the appropriate switch region for recombination and switching.

Different cytokines activate transcription at the appropriate germline promoter.

Because binding sites for B-cell-specific activator protein (BSAP) are located upstream of several switch regions in the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene cluster, BSAP might play a role in the regulation of germline transcription and isotype switching.

# T3 Protein S4 61 65 420 424 BSAP
# T4 Protein S4 162 166 521 525 BSAP

We investigated whether BSAP plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of the epsilon germline promoter in human B cells.
# T5 Protein S5 24 28 635 639 BSAP

Our results showed that BSAP plays a role in both IL-4-dependent induction and CD40-mediated upregulation of human epsilon germline transcription.
# T6 Protein S6 24 28 762 766 BSAP
# T7 Protein S6 50 54 788 792 IL-4
# T8 Protein S6 79 83 817 821 CD40

BSAP is unique among the transcription factors that regulate epsilon germline expression, because it is B cell specific, and is at the merging point of two signalling pathways that are critical for IgE switching.
