LMP1 Promotes B Cell Survival and Proliferation In Vitro
# T1 Protein S1 0 4 0 4 LMP1

(A) MTS assay of splenocytes from WT and LMP1 transgenic mice.
# T2 Protein S2 41 45 98 102 LMP1

Splenocytes were cultured in the presence (grey bars) or absence (black bars) of IL4 for 3 d.
# T3 Protein S3 81 84 201 204 IL4

The results are the mean +/- SEM of triplicate samples averaged from multiple mice where "n" the number of mice analyzed is as follows: n = 2 for WT lymphocytes and WT lymphomas, n = 11 for LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes, and n = 13 for LMP1 transgenic lymphomas.
# T4 Protein S4 190 194 404 408 LMP1
# T5 Protein S4 234 238 448 452 LMP1

(B) EMA exclusion of CD19+ gated splenocytes from WT and LMP1 transgenic mice showing percentage of viable B cells cultured with (white bars) or without (black bars) IL4 for 2 d.
# T6 Protein S5 21 25 497 501 CD19
# T7 Protein S5 57 61 533 537 LMP1
# T8 Protein S5 166 169 642 645 IL4

(C) Flow cytometry analysis for incorporated BrdU in WT and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells cultured with or without IL4 for 2 d. Shown are the results from WT lymphoma 1 and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma 2.
# T9 Protein S6 60 64 716 720 LMP1
# T10 Protein S6 116 119 772 775 IL4
# T11 Protein S6 174 178 830 834 LMP1

Percentages of cells in each quadrant are shown.
