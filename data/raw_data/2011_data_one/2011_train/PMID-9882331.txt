Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 tax protein abrogates interleukin-2 dependence in a mouse T-cell line.

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia.

Tax, the viral protein, is thought to be crucial in the development of the disease, since it transforms healthy T cells in vitro and induces tumors in transgenic animals.
# T3 Protein S3 0 3 200 203 Tax

We examined the effect of Tax activity on the growth of the interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent T-cell line CTLL-2.

# T5 Protein S4 60 73 431 444 interleukin-2
# T6 Protein S4 75 79 446 450 IL-2

Stable expression of Tax in CTLL-2 transformed cell growth from being IL-2 dependent to IL-2 independent.

Tax stimulated transcription through NF-kappaB and the cyclic AMP-responsive element-like sequence in the HTLV-1 promoter.
# T10 Protein S6 0 3 588 591 Tax

The finding of Tax mutants segregating these two pathways suggested that the NF-kappaB pathway was essential for IL-2-independent growth of CTLL-2 cells while the CRE pathway was unnecessary.
# T11 Protein S7 15 18 726 729 Tax
# T12 Protein S7 113 117 824 828 IL-2

However, both pathways were necessary for another transformation-related activity (colony formation in soft agar) of CTLL-2/Tax.
# T13 Protein S8 124 127 1027 1030 Tax

Our results show that Tax has at least two distinct activities on T cells, and suggest that Tax plays a crucial role in IL-2-independent T-cell transformation induced by HTLV-1, in addition to its well-known IL-2-dependent cell transformation.
