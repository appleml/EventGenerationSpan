A novel interferon regulatory factor family transcription factor, ICSAT/Pip/LSIRF, that negatively regulates the activity of interferon-regulated genes.

We have isolated a novel cDNA clone encoding interferon (IFN) consensus sequence-binding protein in adult T-cell leukemia cell line or activated T cells (ICSAT); this protein is the human homolog of the recently cloned Pip/LSIRF.

# T6 Protein S2 219 222 373 376 Pip

ICSAT is structurally most closely related to the previously cloned ICSBP, a member of the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family of proteins that binds to interferon consensus sequences (ICSs) found in many promoters of the IFN-regulated genes.

Among T-cell lines investigated, ICSAT was abundantly expressed in human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-infected T cells.

When the HTLV-1 tax gene was expressed or phorbol myristake acetate-A23187 stimulation was used, ICSAT expression was induced in Jurkat cells which otherwise do not express ICSAT.

When the binding of ICSAT to four different ICSs was tested, the relative differences in binding affinities for those ICSs were determined.

To study the functional role of ICSAT, we performed cotransfection experiments with the human embryonal carcinoma cell line N-Tera2.
# T15 Protein S7 32 37 1107 1112 ICSAT

ICSAT was demonstrated to possess repressive function over the gene activation induced by IFN stimulation or by IRF-1 cotransfection.

Such repressive function is similar to that seen in IRF-2 or ICSBP.
# T18 Protein S9 52 57 1394 1399 IRF-2
# T19 Protein S9 61 66 1403 1408 ICSBP

However, we have found that ICSAT has a different repressive effect from that of IRF-2 or ICSBP in some IFN-responsive reporter constructs.
# T20 Protein S10 28 33 1438 1443 ICSAT
# T21 Protein S10 81 86 1491 1496 IRF-2
# T22 Protein S10 90 95 1500 1505 ICSBP

These results suggest that a novel mechanism of gene regulation by "differential repression" is used by multiple members of repressor proteins with different repressive effects on the IFN-responsive genes.
