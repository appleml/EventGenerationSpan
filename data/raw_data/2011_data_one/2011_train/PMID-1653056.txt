NF-kappa B activation by tumor necrosis factor alpha in the Jurkat T cell line is independent of protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and Ca(2+)-regulated kinases.

NF-kappa B is a DNA-binding regulatory factor able to control transcription of a number of genes, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genes.

In T cells, NF-kappa B is activated upon cellular treatment by phorbol esters and the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha).

# T3 Protein S3 124 133 438 447 TNF alpha

In the present work, we investigated the molecular events leading to NF-kappa B activation by TNF alpha in a human T cell line (Jurkat) and its subclone JCT6, which presents a deficiency in the PKA transduction pathway.
# T4 Protein S4 94 103 544 553 TNF alpha

We found that in both cell lines, both phorbol ester and TNF alpha were able to activate NF-kappa B. Phorbol activation was positively modulated by Ca2+ influx while TNF alpha activation was not.
# T5 Protein S5 57 66 727 736 TNF alpha
# T6 Protein S5 166 175 836 845 TNF alpha

Furthermore, while PMA activation was inhibited by the PKC inhibitor staurosporin, the TNF alpha effect was unchanged.
# T7 Protein S6 87 96 953 962 TNF alpha

TNF alpha did not activate cAMP production and its signal was not modulated by cAMP activators.
# T8 Protein S7 0 9 985 994 TNF alpha

Moreover, cAMP activators did not activate NF-kappa B in Jurkat cells.

Thus, TNF alpha-induced NF-kappa B activation was found to be mediated by none of the major signal-mediating kinases such as protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A, or Ca(2+)-regulated kinases.
# T9 Protein S9 6 15 1158 1167 TNF alpha

Furthermore, we found that cytoplasmic acidification facilitated NF-kappa B activation by both TNF alpha and PKC, by a mechanism that increases NF-kappa B/I kappa B dissociation without affecting the NF-kappa B translocation step.
