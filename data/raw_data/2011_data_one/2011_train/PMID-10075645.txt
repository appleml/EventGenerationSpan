Bacterial lipopolysaccharide activates nuclear factor-kappaB through interleukin-1 signaling mediators in cultured human dermal endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes.

Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated immune responses, including activation of monocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells, play an important role in the pathogenesis of Gram-negative bacteria-induced sepsis syndrome.

Activation of NF-kappaB is thought to be required for cytokine release from LPS-responsive cells, a critical step for endotoxic effects.

Here we investigated the role and involvement of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) signal transducer molecules in LPS signaling in human dermal microvessel endothelial cells (HDMEC) and THP-1 monocytic cells.
# T1 Protein S4 97 106 636 645 TNF-alpha

LPS stimulation of HDMEC and THP-1 cells initiated an IL-1 receptor-like NF-kappaB signaling cascade.

In transient cotransfection experiments, dominant negative mutants of the IL-1 signaling pathway, including MyD88, IRAK, IRAK2, and TRAF6 inhibited both IL-1- and LPS-induced NF-kappaB-luciferase activity.
# T2 Protein S6 108 113 983 988 MyD88
# T3 Protein S6 115 119 990 994 IRAK
# T4 Protein S6 121 126 996 1001 IRAK2
# T5 Protein S6 132 137 1007 1012 TRAF6

LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation was not inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of TRAF2 that is involved in TNF signaling.
# T6 Protein S7 84 89 1165 1170 TRAF2

LPS-induced activation of NF-kappaB-responsive reporter gene was not inhibited by IL-1 receptor antagonist.

TLR2 and TLR4 were expressed on the cell surface of HDMEC and THP-1 cells.

These findings suggest that a signal transduction molecule in the LPS receptor complex may belong to the IL-1 receptor/toll-like receptor (TLR) super family, and the LPS signaling cascade uses an analogous molecular framework for signaling as IL-1 in mononuclear phagocytes and endothelial cells.
