Isolation of a rel-related human cDNA that potentially encodes the 65-kD subunit of NF-kappa B [published erratum appears in Science 1991 Oct 4;254(5028):11]

A DNA probe that spanned a domain conserved among the proto-oncogene c-rel, the Drosophila morphogen dorsal, and the p50 DNA binding subunit of NF-kappa B was generated from Jurkat T cell complementary DNA with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and degenerate oligonucleotides.
# T1 Protein S2 69 74 228 233 c-rel
# T2 Protein S2 117 120 276 279 p50

This probe was used to identify a rel-related complementary DNA that hybridized to a 2.6-kilobase messenger RNA present in human T and B lymphocytes.

In vitro transcription and translation of the complementary DNA resulted in the synthesis of a protein with an apparent molecular size of 65 kilodaltons (kD).

The translated protein showed weak DNA binding with a specificity for the kappa B binding motif.

This protein-DNA complex comigrated with the complex obtained with the purified human p65 NF-kappa B subunit and binding was inhibited by I kappa B-alpha and -beta proteins.
# T3 Protein S6 86 89 931 934 p65
# T4 Protein S6 138 153 983 998 I kappa B-alpha
# T5 Protein S6 158 163 1003 1008 -beta

In addition, the 65-kD protein associated with the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B and the kappa B probe to form a complex with the same electrophoretic mobility as the NF-kappa B-DNA complex.
# T6 Protein S7 51 54 1070 1073 p50
$ T6 Protein S7 51 54 1070 1073 p50
@ T8 Binding S7 31 41 1050 1060 associated
% E1 Binding:T8 Theme:T6

Therefore the rel-related 65-kD protein may represent the p65 subunit of the active NF-kappa B transcription factor complex.
# T7 Protein S8 58 61 1264 1267 p65
