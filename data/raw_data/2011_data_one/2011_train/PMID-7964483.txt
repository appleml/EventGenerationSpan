One gene, two transcripts: isolation of an alternative transcript encoding for the autoantigen La/SS-B from a cDNA library of a patient with primary Sjogrens' syndrome.

# T2 Protein S1 98 102 98 102 SS-B

A cDNA library was prepared from peripheral blood lymphocytes of an autoimmune patient with primary Sjogrens' syndrome.

The cDNA library was screened with the patients own autoimmune serum being monospecific for the nuclear autoantigen La/SS-B.
# T3 Protein S3 104 118 394 408 autoantigen La
# T4 Protein S3 119 123 409 413 SS-B

Thereby an alternative type of La mRNA was identified that differed from the known La mRNA due to an exchange of the exon 1.
# T5 Protein S4 31 33 446 448 La
# T6 Protein S4 83 85 498 500 La

Sequencing of the genomic region between the exons 1 and 2 showed that the alternative 5'-end is a part of the intron.

In addition, the presence of an alternative promoter site, which exists within the intron downstream of the exon 1, became evident.

In consequence, the alternative La mRNA is the result of a promoter switching combined with an alternative splicing mechanism.

In the intron, further transcription factor binding sites, including a NF-kappa B element, were identified leading to the suggestion that the expression of the gene encoding for the nuclear autoantigen La/SS-B alters in dependence on disease conditions.
