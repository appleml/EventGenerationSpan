Dual effects of LPS antibodies on cellular uptake of LPS and LPS-induced proinflammatory functions.

Human phagocytes recognize bacterial LPS (endotoxin) through membrane CD14 (mCD14), a proinflammatory LPS receptor.
# T1 Protein S2 70 74 171 175 CD14
# T2 Protein S2 76 81 177 182 mCD14

This study tested the hypothesis that anti-LPS Abs neutralize endotoxin by blocking cellular uptake through mCD14.
# T3 Protein S3 108 113 325 330 mCD14

Ab-associated changes in the uptake and cellular distribution of FITC-LPS were assessed by flow cytometry and laser scanning confocal microscopy in human CD14-transfected Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts (CHO-CD14 cells) and human peripheral blood monocytes.

LPS core- and O-side chain-specific mAbs inhibited mCD14-mediated LPS uptake by both cell types in the presence of serum.
# T6 Protein S5 51 56 643 648 mCD14

O-side chain-specific mAb concurrently enhanced complement-dependent LPS uptake by monocytes through complement receptor-1 (CR1) and uptake by CHO-CD14 cells involving another heat-labile serum factor(s) and cell-associated recognition molecule(s).

# T8 Protein S6 124 127 838 841 CR1
# T9 Protein S6 147 151 861 865 CD14

Core-specific mAb inhibited mCD14-mediated uptake of homologous and heterologous LPS, while producing less concurrent enhancement of non-mCD14-mediated LPS uptake.
# T10 Protein S7 28 33 991 996 mCD14
# T11 Protein S7 137 142 1100 1105 mCD14

The modulation by anti-LPS mAbs of mCD14-mediated LPS uptake was associated with inhibition of LPS-induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) translocation and TNF-alpha secretion in CHO-CD14 cells and monocytes, respectively, while mAb enhancement of non-mCD14-mediated LPS uptake stimulated these activities.

LPS-specific Abs thus mediate anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory functions, respectively, by preventing target cell uptake of LPS through mCD14 and augmenting uptake through CR1 or other cell receptors.
