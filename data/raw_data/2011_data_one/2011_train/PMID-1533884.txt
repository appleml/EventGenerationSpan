Activation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer is not dependent on NFAT-1.
# T1 Protein S1 83 89 83 89 NFAT-1

The function of a putative NFAT-1 site in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer has been analyzed.
# T2 Protein S2 27 33 119 125 NFAT-1

Activation by the T-cell antigen receptor is minimal in Jurkat cells and is mediated by the kappa B sites.

The putative NFAT-1 region is not required for the response to anti-CD3 or to mitogens in T-cell, B-cell, or monocyte/macrophage leukemia lines, nor is it a cis-acting negative regulatory element.
# T3 Protein S4 13 19 322 328 NFAT-1
