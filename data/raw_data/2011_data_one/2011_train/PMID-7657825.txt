Constitutive activation of different Jak tyrosine kinases in human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) tax protein or virus-transformed cells.
# T1 Protein S1 105 108 105 108 tax

HTLV-1 infection causes an adult T cell leukemia in humans.

The viral encoded protein tax, is thought to play an important role in oncogenesis.
# T2 Protein S3 26 29 232 235 tax

Our previous data obtained from a tax transgenic mouse model revealed that tax transforms mouse fibroblasts but not thymocytes, despite comparable levels of tax expression in both tissues.

Constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of a 130-kD protein(s) was observed in the tax transformed fibroblast B line and in HTLV-1 transformed human lymphoid lines, but not in thymocytes from Thy-tax transgenic mice.
# T6 Protein S5 81 84 560 563 tax

Phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis with a set of Jak kinase specific antibodies, identified p130 as Jak2 in the tax transformed mouse fibroblastic cell line and Jak3 in HTLV-1 transformed human T cell lines.

# T8 Protein S6 147 150 841 844 tax
# T9 Protein S6 196 200 890 894 Jak3

Phosphorylation of Jak2 in tax transformed cells resulted from high expression of IL-6.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein could also be induced in Balb/c3T3 cells using a supernatant from the B line, which was associated with induction of cell proliferation.

Both phosphorylation and proliferation were inhibited by IL-6 neutralizing antibodies.

Constitutive phosphorylation of Jak kinases may facilitate tumor growth in both HTLV-1 infected human T cells and the transgenic mouse model.
