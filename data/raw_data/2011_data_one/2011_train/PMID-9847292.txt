Interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-beta promoter polymorphisms in allergies and asthma.
# T1 Protein S1 0 14 0 14 Interleukin-10

Interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) are inhibitory for B and T cells, IgE production, and mast cell proliferation, and they induce apoptosis in eosinophils.
# T2 Protein S2 0 14 100 114 Interleukin-10
# T3 Protein S2 16 21 116 121 IL-10

These cytokines are therefore candidate genes which could contribute to the development of asthma or allergies.

We investigated the hypothesis that polymorphic nucleotides within the IL-10 and TGF-beta gene promoters would link to the expression of allergies and asthma.
# T4 Protein S4 71 76 474 479 IL-10

DNA taken from families with an asthmatic proband was examined for base exchanges by single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP).

We demonstrated the presence of a polymorphism in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene and four in the TGF-beta gene promoters (3 in TGF-beta1 and 1 in TGF-beta2).
# T5 Protein S6 77 82 776 781 IL-10
# T6 Protein S6 134 143 833 842 TGF-beta1
# T7 Protein S6 153 162 852 861 TGF-beta2

The IL-10 gene polymorphism was a C-to-A exchange 571 base pairs upstream from the translation start site and was present between consensus binding sequences for Sp1 and elevated total serum.
# T8 Protein S7 4 9 868 873 IL-10
# T9 Protein S7 162 165 1026 1029 Sp1

This polymorphism was associated with elevated total serum IgE in subjects heterozygotic or homozygotic for this base exchange (p < 0.009).

The base exchange at -509 (from the transcription initiation site) in the TGF-beta promoter also linked to elevated total IgE (p < 0.01).

This polymorphism represented a C-to-T base exchange which induced a YY1 consensus sequence and is present in a region of the promoter associated with negative transcription regulation.
