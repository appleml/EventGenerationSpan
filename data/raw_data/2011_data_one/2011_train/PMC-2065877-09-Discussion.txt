Discussion

This study defines the oncogenic properties of LMP1 in promoting B cell lymphomagenesis.
# T1 Protein S2 47 51 58 62 LMP1

LMP1 transgenic mice have a higher incidence of lymphoma [26] and the progression to lymphoma correlates with higher expression levels of LMP1 (Figure 1A and 1B), suggesting that LMP1 is directly involved in tumor development.

Table 1 summarizes the biological and molecular properties that were identified in wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas.
# T5 Protein S4 97 101 424 428 LMP1

Although many of the molecular properties studied were similar between wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas, there were distinguishing biological properties, namely the ability of LMP1 transgenic lymphomas to induce higher levels of survival and proliferation.
# T6 Protein S5 85 89 536 540 LMP1
# T7 Protein S5 183 187 634 638 LMP1

Interestingly, although LMP1 transgenic mice develop lymphomas in the same B-1a cell type as spontaneous wild-type lymphomas (Figure 2), some signaling effects induced by LMP1 may explain the enhanced promotion to lymphomagenesis.

Since CD40-deficient mice have decreased numbers of IgMhighIgDlow cells, a phenotype associated with B-1, marginal zone, and memory B cells, the mimicry of CD40 signaling by LMP1 could possibly contribute to the expansion of B-1 cells [20].

It is noteworthy that expression of LMP1 in transgenic mice has been shown to inhibit the formation of GCs [23,49], preventing typical B-2 cells from antigen-driven selection and expansion.

The lack of GC reactions may contribute to the bias of LMP1 transgenic mice towards B-1 cell lymphomas.
# T14 Protein S9 55 59 1432 1436 LMP1

Interestingly, LMP2 signaling also favors development of B-1 cells, but this occurs in the absence of transformation.
# T15 Protein S10 15 19 1496 1500 LMP2

These results suggest that the mimicry of B cell receptor signaling by LMP2 promotes B-1 cell differentiation but not transformation [24,50,51].
# T16 Protein S11 71 75 1670 1674 LMP2

This promotion of B-1 differentiation may account for the ability of LMP2 to exacerbate autoimmunity and bypass anergy induction [52,53].
# T17 Protein S12 69 73 1813 1817 LMP2

In contrast, the preponderance of tumors of B-1a origin does not reflect effects of LMP1 signaling on B cell differentiation, as splenic B cells from healthy LMP1 transgenic mice contain similar numbers of B-1 and B-2 cells as wild-type mice.
# T18 Protein S13 84 88 1966 1970 LMP1
# T19 Protein S13 158 162 2040 2044 LMP1

In support of this lack of effect, the differentiation of B-1 versus B-2 cells is thought to be independent of CD40 signaling [54].
# T20 Protein S14 111 115 2236 2240 CD40

B-1 cells constitute the predominant lymphocyte population in the peritoneal and pleuropericardial cavities, while B-2 cells are mainly found in the spleen, lymph node, and peripheral blood.

B-1 cells produce the main source of IgM and IgA antibodies in serum, which are involved in T cell-independent responses to common microbial antigens.

Importantly, B-1 cells have the unique capacity to self replenish and are also predisposed to transformation [28,29].

Clonal expansion of B-1 cells can be detected in aging mice above 18 mo of age, and B-1 cells are thought to be the murine progenitor of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia [30].

The data presented in this study indicate that although LMP1 is expressed in all B lymphocytes in the transgenic mice, malignancy develops in this specific subset of B cells.

The elevated expression of LMP1 in B-1a cells and the activation of specific pathways apparently induce malignant growth.

These same pathways can also become sporadically activated in aged mice and also result in lymphoma development.

This is similar to EBV-associated cancers in vivo, where pathways that are activated by LMP1 are also activated in the less prevalent EBV-negative forms of the cancers [40,55-58].
# T23 Protein S22 88 92 3395 3399 LMP1

Thus, the contribution of EBV and LMP1 to tumor development is apparently the continuous activation of pathways that can also be sporadically activated and contribute to tumor development.
# T24 Protein S23 34 38 3521 3525 LMP1

The lymphomas were marked by the upregulation of IL10, constitutive activation of Stat3 signaling, and a requirement for activation of Akt, NFkappaB, and Stat3 pathways (Figures 5 and 7).

Induction of IL10 is associated with the transformation of B-1 lymphomas in mice [59,60] and is frequently associated with EBV-positive B cell malignancies acting as a B cell growth factor [35-38].

This suggests that although Stat3 is constitutively activated in the lymphoma cells, the induction of IL10 may further enhance Stat3 activation or may contribute to other IL10-responsive signaling pathways.

LMP1 activates both the canonical and non-canonical pathways of NFkappaB signaling [14,63-65], and inhibition of NFkappaB blocked the survival of LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and LMP1-positive and -negative lymphoma cells.

NFkappaB and PI3K signaling are crucial for CD40-induced proliferation, and mice deficient for cRel or the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K are unresponsive to mitogenic stimuli, including CD40 ligation [66-68].

We have previously shown that cRel is specifically activated in both wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas, suggesting that activation of cRel is associated with B cell transformation [27].

Our observations suggest that similar to CD40-induced proliferation, LMP1 induces proliferation through PI3K-mediated activation of Akt and activation of NFkappaB components such as cRel.

CD40 also induces downregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 through a PI3K-dependent manner, and the LMP1 lymphoma cells also had decreased levels of p27 with phosphorylation of Rb and increased Cdk2 (Figure 6C) [66].

This effect has also been described in EBV-positive HD biopsies [40].

Although the activation of Akt and the lack of Fox01 in the lymphoma cells suggest that LMP1 affects bcl6 and GC formation through this pathway, regulation of other Forkhead targets involved in cell cycle progression, such as p27 and CyclinD2, likely contribute to malignant transformation.

CyclinD2 has also been shown to be upregulated by LMP1 through release of FoxO1-mediated repression [70].

In summary, in this transgenic model of lymphomagenesis, LMP1 promotes malignancy in B-1a cells, a population that is predisposed to clonal expansion with age.

The malignant lymphocytes were distinguished by constitutively active Stat3 signaling, decreased p27, and activated Akt and NFkappaB pathways, properties that are associated with promoting the growth and survival of B lymphocytes.

Importantly, Akt, NFkappaB, and Stat3 pathways were critically required for the growth and survival of malignant lymphocytes as well as healthy LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes.

The growth of EBV-transformed lymphocytes also requires activation of NFkappaB, and these studies provide insight into how LMP1 contributes to EBV-associated transformation.

The transgenic lymphomas mirror multiple aspects of EBV-induced tumors and suggest that in vivo these properties of LMP1 are major factors in the development of cancer.
