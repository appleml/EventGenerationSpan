Biphasic control of NF-kappa B activation induced by the triggering of HLA-DR antigens expressed on B cells.

The regulation of NF-kappa B activation following the triggering of HLA-DR antigens by mAb L243 has been studied at various times in Raji cells.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated a strong increase of NF-kappa B DNA binding after triggering of HLA-DR antigens.

Using TNF-alpha-activity neutralizing antibodies, the authors demonstrated that the upregulation of NF-kappa B was found to depend, at later time point, on an autocrine effect of TNF-alpha secreted following triggering of HLA-DR antigens.

In contrast, it was found to be TNF-alpha independent in the early time point.

Moreover, the upregulation of NF-kappa B binding activity is regulated by the triggering of selected epitopes of HLA-DR antigens.

In fact, mAb L243 but not the staphylococcal superantigens, staphylococcal exotoxin toxic shock syndrome toxin-I or staphylococcal enterotoxin B, regulate the NF-kappa B binding activity.
