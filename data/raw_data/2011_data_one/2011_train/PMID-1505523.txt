TAR-independent transactivation by Tat in cells derived from the CNS: a novel mechanism of HIV-1 gene regulation.
# T1 Protein S1 35 38 35 38 Tat

The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is essential for productive infection and is a potential target for antiviral therapy.
# T2 Protein S2 4 7 119 122 Tat

Tat, a potent activator of HIV-1 gene expression, serves to greatly increase the rate of transcription directed by the viral promoter.
# T3 Protein S3 0 3 265 268 Tat

This induction, which seems to be an important component in the progression of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), may be due to increased transcriptional initiation, increased transcriptional elongation, or a combination of these processes.

Much attention has been focused on the interaction of Tat with a specific RNA target termed TAR (transactivation responsive) which is present in the leader sequence of all HIV-1 mRNAs.

This interaction is believed to be an important component of the mechanism of transactivation.

In this report we demonstrate that in certain CNS-derived cells Tat is capable of activating HIV-1 through a TAR-independent pathway.
# T5 Protein S7 64 67 994 997 Tat

A Tat-responsive element is found upstream within the viral promoter that in glial-derived cell lines allows transactivation in the absence of TAR.
# T6 Protein S8 2 5 1066 1069 Tat

Deletion mapping and hybrid promoter constructs demonstrate that the newly identified Tat-responsive element corresponds to a sequence within the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) previously identified as the HIV-1 enhancer, or NF-kappa B domain.
# T7 Protein S9 86 89 1298 1301 Tat

DNA band-shift analysis reveals NF-kappa B binding activity in glial cells that differs from that present in T lymphoid cells.

Further, we observe that TAR-deleted mutants of HIV-1 demonstrate normal late gene expression in glial cells as evidenced by syncytia formation and production of viral p24 antigen.
