Isolation and culture of primary CD8+ T cells.

CD8+ T cells from 4-8-wk-old Tcra-/- x P14 TCR transgenic (Taconic), C57BL/6J WT, or Tbx21-/- (The Jackson Laboratory) mice were purified (>95% purity) by negative selection (Invitrogen) from pooled spleen and lymph node cells.
# T1 Protein S2 0 3 47 50 CD8
# T2 Protein S2 29 33 76 80 Tcra
# T3 Protein S2 85 90 132 137 Tbx21

CD8+ T cells from Runx3-/- mice on the ICR background were purified by positive selection (Miltenyi Biotec).
# T4 Protein S3 0 3 275 278 CD8
# T5 Protein S3 18 23 293 298 Runx3

All mice were maintained in specific pathogen-free barrier facilities and used according to protocols approved by the Immune Disease Institute and the Harvard Medical School Animal Care and Use Committees.

For stimulation, purified CD8+ T cells were cultured at 106 cells/ml (10 ml) in T25 flasks coated with 1 mug/ml each of anti-CD3 (clone 2C11) and anti-CD28 (clone 37.51) by pretreatment with 300 mug/ml goat anti-hamster IgG.
# T6 Protein S5 26 29 616 619 CD8
# T7 Protein S5 125 128 715 718 CD3
# T8 Protein S5 151 155 741 745 CD28

After 48 h, cells were removed from the TCR stimulation and recultured at a concentration of 5 x 105 cells/ml in media supplemented with 100 U/ml rhIL-2.

Every 24 h, viable cells were counted and readjusted to 5 x 105 cells/ml with fresh media containing the corresponding amount of rhIL-2.
