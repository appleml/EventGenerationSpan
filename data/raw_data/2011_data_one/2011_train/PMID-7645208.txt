Infection and replication of Tat- human immunodeficiency viruses: genetic analyses of LTR and tat mutations in primary and long-term human lymphoid cells.

Tat is an essential regulatory protein for the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
# T3 Protein S2 0 3 156 159 Tat

Mutations in the tat gene have been shown to block HIV replication in human T cells.
# T4 Protein S3 17 20 271 274 tat

Several studies have established that Tat releases an elongation block to the transcription of HIV long terminal repeat (LTR); however, it is not known whether this mechanism alone is sufficient to explain the block to HIV replication in human T cells when Tat is absent.

It is possible that Tat is also needed for other functions during HIV replication.

To test these hypotheses, we studied several tat mutants, including two stop codon mutants and one deletion mutant using replication-competent HIV-1 constructs carrying wild-type or mutant LTRs with modifications in the NF-kappa B and/or Sp1 binding sites.

# T9 Protein S6 238 241 932 935 Sp1

In this study, we show that Tat- HIV-1 with wild-type LTRs can replicate in HeLa cells, and the virus produced from HeLa cells can infect primary peripheral blood lymphocytes and macrophages.

It was found that the propagation of the Tat mutants containing wild-type LTRs was less efficient than that of the LTR-modified Tat mutants.
# T11 Protein S8 41 44 1184 1187 Tat
# T12 Protein S8 128 131 1271 1274 Tat

Large amounts of viral RNA and particles were synthesized in infections established using the tat mutants that contain modified LTRs.
# T13 Protein S9 94 97 1378 1381 tat

However, this efficient propagation of the LTR-modified tat mutants was restricted to some lymphoid cell lines that have been transformed with other viruses.
# T14 Protein S10 56 59 1474 1477 tat

Thus, despite its essential role for releasing an elongation block, Tat is not otherwise absolutely required for synthesis of full-length HIV transcripts and assembly of virus particles.
# T15 Protein S11 68 71 1644 1647 Tat

Direct sequencing of the viral genomes and reinfection kinetics showed no evidence of wild-type reversion even after prolonged infection with the Tat- virus.
# T16 Protein S12 146 149 1909 1912 Tat

The implications for in vivo HIV-1 replication and potential application of this system to the study of alternative Tat function are discussed.
