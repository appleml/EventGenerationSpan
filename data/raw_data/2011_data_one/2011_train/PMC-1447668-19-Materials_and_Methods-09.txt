Transcription factor DNA-binding analysis (TF-ELISA).

CREB-1 and ATF-2 DNA-binding activity was analyzed with the TransFactor Profiling (Inflammation 1) Kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Nuclear extracts were prepared from HEK 293T cells transfected with a control vector (EGFP) or Foxp3 expression vector (1,000 ng) in the presence or absence of forskolin (10 muM for 4 h) using the TransFactor Extraction Kit (BD Biosciences).

Protein concentration was determined using a Biophotometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).

Nuclear extracts (20 mug) were incubated in preblocked wells containing plate-bound double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to an ATF/CREB consensus sequence (emTGACATCAem).

Wells were washed, incubated with the appropriate primary antibody, washed, incubated with secondary antibody (HRP-labeled), washed again, and finally developed with TMB substrate.

Colorimetric reactions were read using a VersaMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at an absorbance of 655 nm.
