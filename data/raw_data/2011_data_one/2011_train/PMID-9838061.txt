Anaphylatoxins C5a and C3a induce nuclear factor kappaB activation in human peripheral blood monocytes.

The anaphylatoxins C5a and C3a are involved in the regulation of cytokine production.

# T4 Protein S2 27 30 132 135 C3a

In this study the capability of C5a and C3a to induce transcription factor activation was examined.

C5a and C3a stimulation of human peripheral blood monocytes resulted in nuclear expression of a DNA binding activity with specificity to the kappaB sequence.

The p50 and p65 proteins, constituents of the prototypic nuclear factor kappaB, were identified as components of the DNA-protein complexes by anti-peptide antibodies in gel supershift assays.

C5a induced kappaB binding activity was detected 15 min after agonist stimulation, peaked at 30-40 min, and remained detectable at 2 h. Binding to kappaB sequence was accompanied by an initial decrease and subsequent increase in the cytoplasmic IkappaBalpha levels, as detected by Western blotting using an anti-IkappaBalpha antibody.

Pertussis toxin treatment markedly decreased kappaB binding activities induced by both C5a and C3a, whereas cholera toxin displayed no inhibitory effect.

Neither of the two toxins affected kappaB binding activity induced by TNFalpha in the same cells.

These results imply a potential role of the anaphylatoxins C5a and C3a in regulating leukocytes gene expression through G protein-coupled transcription factor activation.
