IFN-gamma has potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in T cells that are important in determining T cell development and polarized differentiation.

Therefore, any event that enables T cells to become less responsive to IFN- gamma may potentially alter immune responsiveness to Ag.
# T4 Protein S3 71 81 366 376 IFN- gamma

In this work, we show that human peripheral blood T cells that are stimulated through the TCR and expanded with IL-2 are unresponsive to IFN-gamma, as determined by a lack of activation of jak kinases and the transcription factor, STAT1(alpha), a signal transducer and activator of transcription.

This nonresponsiveness occurs because of a lack of expression of the beta- chain (accessory factor) of the IFN-gamma receptor, while at the same time maintaining IFN-gamma receptor alpha-chain expression.

Expression of the beta-chain can be restored by secondary TCR ligation or PMA treatment.

T cell blasts treated with PMA are now responsive to IFN-gamma.
# T9 Protein S7 53 62 1072 1081 IFN-gamma

When freshly isolated, highly enriched (>98%) T cells are examined for IFN-gamma responsiveness; these cells can respond to IFN-gamma and express beta-chain.
# T10 Protein S8 71 80 1154 1163 IFN-gamma
# T11 Protein S8 124 133 1207 1216 IFN-gamma

Therefore, as T cells progress from primary TCR activation through IL-2-dependent proliferation, followed by secondary TCR stimulation, their responsiveness to IFN-gamma varies, and this may affect their ability to participate in an ongoing immune response.
