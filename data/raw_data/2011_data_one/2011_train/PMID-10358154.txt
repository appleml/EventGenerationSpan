New immunosuppressive drug PNU156804 blocks IL-2-dependent proliferation and NF-kappa B and AP-1 activation.

We had previously shown that the drug undecylprodigiosin (UP) blocks human lymphocyte proliferation in vitro.

We have now investigated the mechanism of action of a new analogue of UP, PNU156804, which shows a more favorable activity profile than UP in mice.

We demonstrate here that the biological effect of PNU156804 in vitro is indistinguishable from UP: PNU156804 blocks human T cell proliferation in mid-late G1, as determined by cell cycle analysis, expression of cyclins, and cyclin-dependent kinases and retinoblastoma phosphorylation.

In addition, we show that PNU156804 does not block significantly the induction of either IL-2 or IL-2R alpha- and gamma-chains but inhibits IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation.

We have investigated several molecular pathways that are known to be activated by IL-2 in T cells.

On the other hand, PNU156804 efficiently inhibits the activation of the NF-kappa B and AP-1 transcription factors.

PNU156804 inhibition of NF-kappa B activation is due to the inhibition of the degradation of I kappa B-alpha and I kappa B-beta.

PNU156804 action is restricted to some signaling pathways; it does not affect NF-kappa B activation by PMA in T cells but blocks that induced by CD40 cross-linking in B lymphocytes.

We conclude that the prodigiosin family of immunosuppressants is a new family of molecules that show a novel target specificity clearly distinct from that of other immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A, FK506, and rapamycin.
