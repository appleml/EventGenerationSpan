Nitric oxide subserves diverse physiologic roles in the nervous system.

NO is produced from at least three different NO synthase (NOS) isoforms: neuronal NOS (nNOS), endothelial NOS, and immunologic NOS (iNOS).

# T4 Protein S3 87 91 301 305 nNOS

# T6 Protein S3 115 130 329 344 immunologic NOS
# T7 Protein S3 132 136 346 350 iNOS

We show that nNOS is the predominant isoform constitutively expressed in glia.

NO derived from nNOS in glia inhibits the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF kappaB) as NOS inhibitors enhance basal NF kappaB activation.
# T9 Protein S5 16 20 448 452 nNOS

Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) is an inhibitor of NF kappaB in most cells; however, we show that PDTC is also a potent scavenger of NO through formation of mononitrosyl iron complexes with PDTC.

In Jurkat cells, a human T-cell lymphoma cell line, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induces NF kappaB activation that is inhibited by PDTC.
# T10 Protein S7 52 79 834 861 tumor necrosis factor-alpha
# T11 Protein S7 81 90 863 872 TNF-alpha

Contrary to the results in Jurkat cells, PDTC did not inhibit tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced NF kappaB activation in astrocytes; instead PDTC itself induces NF kappaB activation in astrocytes, and this may be related to scavenging of endogenously produced NO by the PDTC iron complex.
# T12 Protein S8 62 89 992 1019 tumor necrosis factor-alpha

In astrocytes PDTC also dramatically induces the NF kappaB-dependent enzyme, iNOS, supporting the physiologic relevance of endogenous NO regulation of NF kappaB.

NF kappaB activation in glia from mice lacking nNOS responds more rapidly to PDTC compared with astrocytes from wild-type mice.

Our data suggest that nNOS in astrocytes regulates NF kappaB activity and iNOS expression, and indicate a novel regulatory role for nNOS in tonically suppressing central nervous system, NF kappaB-regulated genes.
