The human interleukin-3 (IL-3) gene is expressed almost exclusively in activated T cells.

We have previously shown that treatment of Jurkat T cells with phytohemaglutinin (PHA) and the phorbol ester, PMA, activated transcription initiation from the IL-3 gene.

To define the regions of the gene required for transcription activation, we generated a series of reporter constructs containing different regions of the IL-3 gene 5' and 3' flanking sequences.

Both positive and negative regulatory elements were identified in the proximal 5' flanking region of the IL-3 gene.
# T8 Protein S6 105 109 711 715 IL-3

The promoter region between -173 and -60 contained the strongest activating elements.

The transcription factor AP-1 could bind to this positive activator region of the promoter.

We also examined the function of the IL-3 CK-1/CK-2 elements that are present in many cytokine genes and found that they acted as a repressor of basal level expression when cloned upstream of a heterologous promoter but were also inducible by PMA/PHA.
