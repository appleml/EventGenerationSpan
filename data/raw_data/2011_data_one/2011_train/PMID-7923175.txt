T cells from renal cell carcinoma patients exhibit an abnormal pattern of kappa B-specific DNA-binding activity: a preliminary report.

Recent data suggest that the poor induction of a T-cell response to human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) may be related to alterations in signal transduction pathways.

We report that T cells from RCC patients have two alterations in kappa B motif-specific DNA-binding activity.

The first alteration involves the constitutive expression of substantial kappa B-binding activity in nuclear extracts, which was observed in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay.

The magnitude of kappa B activity in unstimulated patient T cells was similar to that observed in T cells from normal individuals that had been activated in vitro.

On the basis of Western blotting experiments using antibodies to kappa B/Rel family proteins, the kappa B-binding activity constitutively expressed in T cells from RCC patients is composed mostly of the NF-kappa B1 (p50) subunit.
# T1 Protein S6 203 214 960 971 NF-kappa B1
# T2 Protein S6 216 219 973 976 p50
$ T1 Protein S6 203 214 960 971 NF-kappa B1
@ T5 Binding S6 106 122 863 879 binding activity
% E1 Binding:T5 Theme:T1

The second abnormality in kappa B-binding activity in T cells from these patients is that RelA, a member of the Rel homology family which is part of the normal NF-kappa B complex, was not induced in the nucleus following activation.
# T3 Protein S7 90 94 1077 1081 RelA
$ T3 Protein S7 90 94 1077 1081 RelA
@ T6 Positive_regulation S7 188 195 1175 1182 induced
% E2 Positive_regulation:T6 Theme:T3

Western blotting analysis did not detect any RelA in nuclear extracts either before or after stimulation of T cells.
# T4 Protein S8 45 49 1265 1269 RelA
$ T4 Protein S8 45 49 1265 1269 RelA

The altered kappa B-binding activity in T cells from RCC patients may impair their capacity to respond normally to various stimuli.
