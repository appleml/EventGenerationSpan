STAT-related transcription factors are constitutively activated in peripheral blood cells from acute leukemia patients.

A signal transduction pathway activated by many cytokines has recently been elaborated.

The JAK kinases and the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) factors have been found to be essential components.

In this report, we describe the presence of constitutively activated STAT factors in peripheral blood cells from patients with acute leukemia.

We used oligonucleotide probes from the beta-casein and IRF-1 gene promoters and the ISRE probe to detect STAT proteins in nuclear extracts from acute leukemia cells in bandshift assays.
# T1 Protein S5 40 51 526 537 beta-casein
# T2 Protein S5 56 61 542 547 IRF-1

Specific DNA protein complex formation was observed with the probes from the beta-casein and IRF-1 gene promoters, but not with the ISRE oligonucleotide probe, when cell extracts from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were investigated.
# T3 Protein S6 77 88 750 761 beta-casein
# T4 Protein S6 93 98 766 771 IRF-1
$ T4 Protein S6 93 98 766 771 IRF-1
$ T3 Protein S6 77 88 750 761 beta-casein
@ T10 Binding S6 21 38 694 711 complex formation
@ T11 Entity S6 104 113 777 786 promoters

% E2 Binding:T10 Theme:T3 Site:T11

We used nonradioactive oligonucleotides as competitors to show the specificity of the complex formation.

Specific antibodies directed against the individual STAT proteins were used in supershift experiments.

STAT5- and STAT1-related factors were detected in ALL and STAT1-, STAT3-, and STAT5-related proteins were present in nuclear cell extracts from AML.
# T5 Protein S9 0 5 1152 1157 STAT5
# T6 Protein S9 11 16 1163 1168 STAT1
# T7 Protein S9 58 63 1210 1215 STAT1
# T8 Protein S9 66 71 1218 1223 STAT3
# T9 Protein S9 78 83 1230 1235 STAT5

Since the cells were not treated with cytokines before the nuclear proteins were extracted, we conclude that these factors are constitutively activated in vivo.

It is likely that the constitutive activation of STAT proteins is a part of the events of leukemogenesis.
