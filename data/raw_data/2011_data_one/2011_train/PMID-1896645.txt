Induction of NF-kappa B during monocyte differentiation is associated with activation of HIV-gene expression.

Cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage are important targets of HIV infection.

We report here that the phenotypic differentiation of monocyte cell lines induced by phorbol esters or tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) is associated with expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B).
# T1 Protein S3 103 131 295 323 tumour necrosis factor alpha
# T2 Protein S3 133 142 325 334 TNF alpha

In parallel with such differentiation, HIV transcription, monitored using an HIV long terminal repeat reporter gene construct, is activated in such cells under the influence of enhanced NF-kappa B expression.

Also, in a promonocyte cell line chronically infected with HIV, NF-kappa B expression and HIV transcription were enhanced on stimulation with phorbol ester or TNF alpha.
# T3 Protein S5 159 168 774 783 TNF alpha

Thus, stimulation of monocyte cell lines by phorbol esters or TNF alpha induces cell differentiation and activates HIV transcription.
# T4 Protein S6 62 71 847 856 TNF alpha

Such a process may have fundamental implications in AIDS pathogenesis in vivo and may be important in disease progression induced by opportunistic infections directly or indirectly involving macrophages.
