Characterization of a new isoform of the NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) gene family member NFATc [published erratum appears in J Biol Chem 1996 Dec 27;271(52):33705]

The cyclosporin A (CsA)/FK506-sensitive nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) plays a key role in the inducible expression of cytokine genes in T cells.

Although NFAT has been recently shown to be inducible in several non-T immune cells, the NFAT gene family members characterized to date have been isolated only from T cells.

To further characterize NFAT function in human B cells and to demonstrate cytokine gene specificity of NFAT proteins, we report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone from the Raji B cell line.

The cDNA clone encodes a new isoform, NFATc.beta, of the NFAT gene family member NFATc (designated here NFATc.alpha).

# T3 Protein S5 81 86 803 808 NFATc
# T4 Protein S5 104 115 826 837 NFATc.alpha

The amino acid sequence of NFATc.beta differs from that of NFATc.alpha in the first NH2-terminal 29 residues and contains an additional region of 142 residues at the COOH terminus.

# T6 Protein S6 59 70 899 910 NFATc.alpha

Northern analysis using a probe encompassing a common region of both isoforms showed two mRNA species of 2.7 and 4.5 kilobase pairs, while an NFATc.beta-specific probe detected only the 4.5-kilobase pair mRNA which was preferentially expressed in the spleen.
# T7 Protein S7 142 152 1163 1173 NFATc.beta

Transient expression of NFATc.beta was capable of activating an interleukin-2 NFAT-driven reporter gene in stimulated Jurkat cells in a CsA-sensitive manner.

However, NFATc.beta neither bound to the kappa3 element ( an NFAT-binding site ) in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter nor activated the tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter in cotransfection assays.

These data suggest that different members or isoforms of NFAT gene family may regulate inducible expression of different cytokine genes.
