Dopamine stimulates expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 via NF-kappaB in cells of the immune system.

Recent studies have reported that lymphocytes produce, transport and bind dopamine present in plasma.

However, the action of dopamine on HIV-1 gene expression in cells of the immune system has not yet been examined.

Here, we have investigated the regulation of HIV-1 expression by dopamine in Jurkat T cells and in primary blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).

HIV-1 replication was increased by dopamine, which correlated with the increased levels of HIV-1 transactivation.

Our transient expression data revealed that dopamine stimulated transcription through the NF-kappaB element present in the long terminal repeat.

The importance of NF-kappaB sites was confirmed by using vectors containing wild-type or mutant kappaB sites in a heterologous promoter.

Consistent with the role of NF-kappaB in mediating dopamine responsiveness, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 abolished dopamine-induced transcriptional activation.

We further explored the effect of dopamine in the presence of phorbol esters or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) known to activate NF-kappaB.
# T1 Protein S9 80 107 1113 1140 tumor necrosis factor-alpha
# T2 Protein S9 109 118 1142 1151 TNF-alpha

The combination of dopamine and TNF-alpha led to a stimulation of HIV-1 transcription and replication.
# T3 Protein S10 32 41 1214 1223 TNF-alpha

However, in contrast with TNF-alpha, dopamine treatment did not affect NF-kappaB DNA binding activity nor the concentrations of p50, p65 and IkappaB-alpha proteins, which suggests a distinct NF-kappaB activation mechanism.

These results reveal a new link between the dopamine system, cytokine signaling pathway and regulation of gene expression via the involvement of NF-kappaB in T cells and PBMC.
