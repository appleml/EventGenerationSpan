Two distinct transcription factors that bind the immunoglobulin enhancer microE5/kappa 2 motif.

Activity of the immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain gene enhancers depends on a complex interplay of ubiquitous and developmentally regulated proteins.

Two complementary DNAs were isolated that encode proteins, denoted ITF-1 and ITF-2, that are expressed in a variety of cell types and bind the microE5/kappa 2 motif found in both heavy and kappa light chain enhancers.

The complementary DNAs are the products of distinct genes, yet both ITF-1 and ITF-2 are structurally and functionally similar.

The two proteins interact with one another through their putative helix-loop-helix motifs and each possesses a distinct domain that dictates transcription activation.
