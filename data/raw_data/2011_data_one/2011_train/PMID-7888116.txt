The regulation of HIV by retinoic acid correlates with cellular expression of the retinoic acid receptors.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the effect of retinoic acids (RA) on HIV-1 expression and correlate this effect with expression levels of RA receptors (RARs) in T-lymphoid and monocytoid cell lines.

DESIGN AND METHODS: The effect of all-trans and 9-cis RA on HIV-1 production in T-lymphoid (H9, CEM) and monocytoid (U937,THP-1) cell lines was measured during acute and chronic infection.

The expression levels of human RAR alpha (hRAR alpha, receptor for all-trans RA) and the human retinoid-X receptor alpha (hRXR alpha receptor for 9-cis RA) were determined by Northern blot analysis.

RESULTS: Both all-trans and 9-cis RA inhibited virus replication in HIV-1 IIIB-infected monocytoid cells, in the presence and absence of the co-stimulatory agent phorbol myristate acetate (PMA).

The retinoids had weak or no stimulatory effects on HIV production by T-cell lines.

HIV production by PMA-stimulated T-cell lines was inhibited by these retinoids.

The 9-cis RA was generally more effective than all-trans RA in inhibiting HIV production and in combination generally more effective than the single agents alone.

Human RAR alpha was expressed in H9, U937 and THP-1 cells, but almost undetectable in CEM cells.

Human RXR alpha was significantly expressed in U937 and THP-1 cells, weakly expressed in H9 cells and not detectable in CEM cells.

After stimulation by PMA, RXR alpha expression increased in H9 and U937 cells but not in CEM cells.

CONCLUSION: The effect of RA on HIV-1 expression was cell-type-dependent and partially correlated with cellular expression of RARs.

Endogenous or exogenously administered RA may have a significant role in HIV regulation.
