Interactions between the class II transactivator and CREB binding protein increase transcription of major histocompatibility complex class II genes.

Class II major histocompatibility (class II) genes are regulated in a B-cell-specific and gamma interferon-inducible fashion.
# T3 Protein S2 90 106 240 256 gamma interferon

The master switch for the expression of these genes is the class II transactivator (CIITA).
# T4 Protein S3 59 82 335 358 class II transactivator
# T5 Protein S3 84 89 360 365 CIITA

In this report, we demonstrate that one of the functions of CIITA is to recruit the CREB binding protein (CBP) to class II promoters.

Not only functional but also specific binding interactions between CIITA and CBP were demonstrated.

Moreover, a dominant negative form of CBP decreased the activity of class II promoters and levels of class II determinants on the surface of cells.
# T11 Protein S6 38 41 640 643 CBP

Finally, the inhibition of class II gene expression by the glucocorticoid hormone could be attributed to the squelching of CBP by the glucocorticoid receptor.

We conclude that CBP, a histone acetyltransferase, plays an important role in the transcription of class II genes.
