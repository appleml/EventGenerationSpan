Effects of CD45 on NF-kappa B. Implications for replication of HIV-1.
# T1 Protein S1 11 15 11 15 CD45

Increased levels of replication of the HIV type 1 are observed after the activation of infected T cells through the TCR.

However, anti-CD45 antibodies inhibit these effects in cells from infected individuals.
# T2 Protein S3 14 18 206 210 CD45

In this study, we examined interrelationships between CD45 and HIV-1 further.
# T3 Protein S4 54 58 334 338 CD45

We measured effects on the HIV-1 LTR in T cell lines that were stimulated with antibodies against CD45 and in those that lacked the expression of CD45 on their surfaces.

First, anti-CD45 antibodies did not affect basal but decreased activated levels of expression from the HIV-1 LTR.
# T6 Protein S6 12 16 540 544 CD45

Second, T cells, which lack CD45 and cannot signal via the TCR, supported higher levels of viral replication and gene expression.

This was due to the presence of active NF-kappa B complexes in the nucleus of CD45- T cells.
# T8 Protein S8 78 82 850 854 CD45

Additionally, infected T cells displayed lower levels of CD45 on their surfaces.

Thus, CD45 plays an active role in the physiology of T cells and in the replication of HIV-1.
