Immunoblotting

Differentiated CD4+ Tcells were rested for 5 hr in 1% FCS-containing medium and restimulated as described for specific experiments.
# T1 Protein S2 15 18 30 33 CD4

Cell lysates were prepared, equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated or total ERK and actin were detected as described before (Beinke etal., 2004).
# T2 Protein S3 109 112 256 259 ERK
# T3 Protein S3 117 122 264 269 actin
