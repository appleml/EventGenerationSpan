Inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB activation attenuates apoptosis resistance in lymphoid cells.

Death-inducing ligands (DILs) such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) or the cytotoxic drug doxorubicin have been shown to activate a nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB)-dependent program that may rescue cells from apoptosis induction.
# T1 Protein S2 38 65 137 164 tumor necrosis factor alpha
# T2 Protein S2 67 75 166 174 TNFalpha

We demonstrate here that TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), a recently identified DIL, also activates NFkappaB in lymphoid cell lines in a kinetic similar to TNFalpha.
# T3 Protein S3 25 30 364 369 TRAIL
# T4 Protein S3 32 69 371 408 TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
# T5 Protein S3 170 178 509 517 TNFalpha

NFkappaB activity is independent from FADD, caspases, and apoptosis induction.
# T6 Protein S4 38 42 557 561 FADD

To study the influence of NFkappaB activity on apoptosis mediated by TRAIL, CD95, TNFalpha, or doxorubicin, NFkappaB activation was inhibited using the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinyl-L-norleucinal or transient overexpression of mutant IkappaBalpha.

Sensitivity for induction of apoptosis was markedly increased by these treatments in apoptosis sensitive cell lines.

Moreover, both in cell lines and in primary leukemia cells that are resistant towards induction of apoptosis by DILs and doxorubicin, antagonization of NFkappaB activity partially restored apoptosis sensitivity.

These data suggest that inhibition of NFkappaB activation may provide a molecular approach to increase apoptosis sensitivity in anticancer treatment.
