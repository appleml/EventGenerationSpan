One feature of this chromatin reorganization is the formation of DNase 1 hypersensitive sites in the regions of active globin gene promoters.

This reorganization requires the globin locus control region and is associated with normal expression of the beta-like globin genes.

To determine whether it is possible to artificially enhance the opening of the chromatin structure of a minimal beta-globin promoter, we placed a 101bp, erythroid-specific DNase 1 hypersensitive site-forming element (HSFE) immediately upstream of the beta-globin promoter and gene.
# T3 Protein S5 112 123 641 652 beta-globin
# T4 Protein S5 251 262 780 791 beta-globin

This element includes binding sites for NF-E2, AP-1, GATA-1 and Sp-1.
# T5 Protein S6 53 59 864 870 GATA-1
# T6 Protein S6 64 68 875 879 Sp-1

Constructs were stably transfected into murine erythroleukemia cells and promoter chromatin structure and gene expression were analyzed.

The HSFE induced an area of enhanced DNase 1 hypersensitivity extending from the transcriptional start site to -300bp of the artificial promoter and significantly increased the proportion of beta-globin promoters in an open chromatin configuration.

This remodeling of promoter chromatin structure resulted in 3-fold increases in beta-globin gene transcription and induction, and inhibited long-term beta-globin gene silencing.

These results indicate that a relatively small cis-acting element is able to enhance remodeling of promoter chromatin structure resulting in increased beta-globin gene expression.
