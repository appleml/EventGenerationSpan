The host response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis includes granuloma formation at sites of infection and systemic symptoms.

Cytokines have been identified by immunohistochemistry in granulomas in animal models of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) infection and are released by mononuclear phagocytes upon stimulation by mycobacterial proteins.

In this regard, the cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) may play a role in the clinical manifestations and pathological events of tuberculosis infection.

# T4 Protein S4 44 48 605 609 IL-6

We have demonstrated that lipoarabinomannan (LAM) from the mycobacterial cell wall, which was virtually devoid of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), stimulated mononuclear phagocytes to release IL-6 in a dose-response manner.

LAM and LPS were potent inducers of IL-6 gene expression in peripheral blood monocytes.

Both LAM- and LPS-inducible IL-6 promoter activity was localized to a DNA fragment, positions -158 to -49, by deletion analysis and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay.

Two nuclear factor NF-IL6 (positions -153 to -145 and -83 to -75) and one nuclear factor NF-kappa B (positions -72 to -63) motifs are present within this fragment.
# T9 Protein S8 19 25 1206 1212 NF-IL6

Site-directed mutagenesis of one or more of these motifs within the IL-6 promoter demonstrated that each has positive regulatory activity and that they could act in a function- and orientation-independent manner.
# T10 Protein S9 68 72 1419 1423 IL-6

Deletion of all three elements abolished inducibility of IL-6 promoter activity by both LAM and LPS.

We conclude that the NF-IL6 and NF-kappa B sites mediate IL-6 induction in response to both LPS and LAM, acting as bacterial or mycobacterial response elements.
