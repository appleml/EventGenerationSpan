Impaired fetal thymocyte development after efficient adenovirus-mediated inhibition of NF-kappa B activation.

We introduce a new experimental system combining adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC).

This system allowed us to efficiently express in developing thymocytes a mutant form of the NF-kappa B inhibitor I kappa B alpha (mut-I kappa B) and to study the maturation defects occurring when NF-kappa B activation is inhibited during fetal development.

Fetal thymocytes infected with adenovirus containing mut-I kappa B were found to develop normally until the CD44-CD25+, CD4-CD8- double-negative stage, while production of more mature double-positive and single-positive populations was strongly decreased.

Proliferation, as measured by the percentage of cells in cycle appeared normal, as did rearrangement and expression of the TCR beta-chain.

However, apoptosis was much higher in FTOC infected with adenovirus containing mut-I kappa B than in FTOC infected with a control virus.

Taken together, these results suggest that NF-kappa B plays a crucial role in ensuring the differentiation and survival of thymocytes in the early stages of their development.
