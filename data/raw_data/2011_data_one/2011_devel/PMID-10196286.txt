Role of cellular tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors in NF-kappaB activation and lymphocyte transformation by herpesvirus Saimiri STP.

The STP oncoproteins of the herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) subgroup A strain 11 and subgroup C strain 488 are now found to be stably associated with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 1, 2, or 3.

Mutational analyses identified residues of PXQXT/S in STP-A11 as critical for TRAF association.

In addition, a somewhat divergent region of STP-C488 is critical for TRAF association.

Mutational analysis also revealed that STP-C488 induced NF-kappaB activation that was correlated with its ability to associate with TRAFs.

The HVS STP-C488 P10-->R mutant was deficient in human T-lymphocyte transformation to interleukin-2-independent growth but showed wild-type phenotype for marmoset T-lymphocyte transformation in vitro and in vivo.

The STP-C488 P10-->R mutant was also defective in Rat-1 fibroblast transformation, and fibroblast cell transformation was blocked by a TRAF2 dominant-negative mutant.
# T9 Protein S7 4 12 901 909 STP-C488
# T10 Protein S7 135 140 1032 1037 TRAF2

These data implicate TRAFs in STP-C488-mediated transformation of human lymphocytes and rodent fibroblasts.
# T11 Protein S8 30 38 1094 1102 STP-C488

Other factors are implicated in immortalization of common marmoset T lymphocytes and may also be critical in the transformation of human lymphocytes and rodent fibroblasts.
