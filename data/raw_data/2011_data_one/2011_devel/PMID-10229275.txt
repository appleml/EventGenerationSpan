High molecular weight dextran sulfate increases the activity of NF-kappaB-regulated promoter in monocyte-derived macrophages.

It is known that sulfated polysaccharides can mimic the action of common T-cell mitogens.

To investigate the molecular basis of the mitogenic effect of high molecular weight dextran sulfate (HMDS), monocyte-derived macrophages were transfected with recombinant plasmid containing chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter, which is regulated by transcription factor NF-kappaB.
# T1 Protein S3 190 224 407 441 chloramphenicol acetyl transferase
# T2 Protein S3 226 229 443 446 CAT

We observed that HMDS, similar to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), increases the expression of CAT reporter gene suggesting increased activity of NF-kappaB.
# T3 Protein S4 98 101 682 685 CAT

The activation of NF-kappaB correlated with the increased expression of B7.1 molecules.
# T4 Protein S5 72 76 816 820 B7.1
$ T4 Protein S5 72 76 816 820 B7.1
@ T5 Positive_regulation S5 48 57 792 801 increased
@ T6 Gene_expression S5 58 68 802 812 expression
% E1 Positive_regulation:T5 Theme:E2

It was postulated that this NF-kappaB-regulated promoter might play a role in the activation of the accessory cells as well as the rate of replication of HIV-1 in monocyte-derived macrophages.
