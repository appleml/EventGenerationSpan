Anti-CD2 receptor antibodies activate the HIV long terminal repeat in T lymphocytes.
# T1 Protein S1 5 8 5 8 CD2

The CD2 T lymphocyte glycoprotein surface molecule mediates both cell to cell adhesion and T cell activation, two processes that are involved in the spread of HIV infection.
# T2 Protein S2 4 7 90 93 CD2

Treatment of chronically HIV-infected PBMC with anti-CD2 mAb has been shown to induce the expression of infectious virus from these cultures.
# T3 Protein S3 53 56 313 316 CD2

In this study we investigated the mechanisms whereby anti-CD2 antibodies stimulate viral production.
# T4 Protein S4 58 61 460 463 CD2

We demonstrate that treatment of transiently transfected T lymphocytes with anti-CD2 antibodies results in activation of the HIV long terminal repeat.
# T5 Protein S5 81 84 584 587 CD2

Furthermore, CAT assays using mutated HIV long terminal repeat-CAT constructs and gel shift assays demonstrate that this activation is dependent on the NF-kappa B enhancer.
# T6 Protein S6 13 16 667 670 CAT
# T7 Protein S6 63 66 717 720 CAT

These studies suggest that interaction of CD2 with its natural ligand, LFA-3, may play a role in regulation of HIV expression.
