Productive infection of T cells with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) typically requires that the T cells be stimulated with antigens or mitogens.

This requirement has been attributed to the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B, which synergizes with the constitutive transcription factor Sp1 to drive the HIV-1 promoter.

Recently, we have found that vigorous replication of HIV-1 takes place in nonactivated memory T cells after syncytium formation with dendritic cells (DCs).

These syncytia lack activated cells as determined by an absence of staining for Ki-67 cell cycle antigen.

The expression and activity of NF-kappa B and Sp1 were, therefore, analyzed in isolated T cells and DCs from humans and mice.

We have used immunolabeling, Western blot analysis, and electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays.

T cells lack active NF-kappa B but express Sp1 as expected.

DCs express high levels of all known NF-kappa B and Rel proteins, with activity residing primarily within RelB, p50, and p65.

However, DCs lack Sp1, which may explain the failure of HIV-1 to replicate in purified DCs.

Coexpression of NF-kappa B and Sp1 occurs in the heterologous DC-T-cell syncytia that are induced by HIV-1.

Therefore, HIV-1-induced cell fusion brings together factors that upregulate virus transcription.

Since DCs and memory T cells frequently traffic together in situ, these unusual heterologous syncytia could develop in infected individuals and lead to chronic HIV-1 replication without ostensible immune stimulation.
