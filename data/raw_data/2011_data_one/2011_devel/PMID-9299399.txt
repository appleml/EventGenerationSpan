Eotaxin is an eosinophil specific beta-chemokine assumed to be involved in eosinophilic inflammatory diseases such as atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma and parasitic infections.

We here describe the genomic organisation (3 exons of 132, 112 and 542 bp and 2 introns of 1211 and 378 bp) and sequence including 3 kb of DNA from the immediate 5' upstream region of the human eotaxin gene.

Among the regulatory promoter elements potentially regulating eotaxin gene expression and/or mediating the effects of anti-inflammatory drugs we identified consensus sequences known to interact with nuclear factors like NF-IL6, AP-1, a NF-kappa-B like consensus sequence and gamma-interferon- as well as glucocorticoid response elements.
