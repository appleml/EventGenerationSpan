Western blotting.

For FOXP3 analysis on the protein level, 1 x 106 CD4+CD25- cells were lysed and loaded next to a protein-mass ladder (Magicmark, Invitrogen) on a NuPAGE 4-12% bis-tris gel (Invitrogen).
# T1 Protein S2 4 9 22 27 FOXP3
# T2 Protein S2 49 52 67 70 CD4
# T3 Protein S2 53 57 71 75 CD25

The proteins were electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (Amersham Life Science).

Unspecific binding was blocked with BSA, and the membranes were subsequently incubated with an 1:200 dilution of goat anti-FOXP3 in blocking buffer (Abcam) overnight at 4 degreesC.
# T4 Protein S4 123 128 406 411 FOXP3

The blots were developed using an anti-goat HRP-labeled mAb (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized with a LAS 1000 camera (Fuji).

Membranes were incubated in stripping buffer and re-blocked for 1 h.

The membranes were re-probed using anti-GATA3 (HG3-31; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-T-bet (4B10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GAPDH (6C5, Ambion), anti-phospho-SMAD2 (138D4), anti-phospho-STAT6 (5A4), and anti-STAT6 (Cell Signaling Technology),
