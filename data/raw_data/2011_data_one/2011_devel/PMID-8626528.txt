Nuclear appearance of a factor that binds the CD28 response element within the interleukin-2 enhancer correlates with interleukin-2 production.

Activation of T lymphocytes requires the combined signaling of the T cell receptor and costimulatory molecules such as CD28.

The ability of T cells to produce interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a critical control point in T lymphocyte activation.

The IL-2 enhancer contains a functional motif named CD28 response element (CD28RE) that serves a role as a target for mitogenic T cell activation signals.

The CD28RE sequence reveals similarity to the consensus kappaB binding motif.

Here we demonstrate that CD28RE binds an inducible protein with a molecular mass of approximately 35 kDa called nuclear factor of mitogenic-activated T cells (NF-MATp35) that is clearly different from the known NF- kappaB/Rel family members.

Induction of NF-MATp35 was shown to depend on de novo protein synthesis and was restricted to T cells that received a mitogenic combination of T cell stimuli, not necessarily including CD28 signaling.

Nonmitogenic T cell stimulation did not result in appearance of NF-MATp35.

These results indicate that mitogenic combinations of T cell activation signals are integrated at the level of NF-MATp35 induction.

Similar to its effect on IL-2 production, cyclosporin A inhibited the induction of NF-MATp35.

Taken together, these data demonstrate that the nuclear appearance of NF-MATp35 shows excellent correlation with IL-2 production, which is a unique characteristic among nuclear factors implicated in the control of IL-2 gene expression.
