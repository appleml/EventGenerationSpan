Mice.

Normal B6 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine).

Transgenic DO11.10 mice, expressing a T cell receptor for OVA323-339 peptide in the context of H-2d, were backcrossed with mice expressing GATA-3, driven by the human CD2 locus control region (CD2-GATA3) [22], resulting in DO11.10xCD2-GATA3 mice.

Mice used for experiments were backcrossed on a BALB/c background for a minimum of eight generations and used at an age of 8-12 wk.

Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions and all animal studies were performed according to institutional and state guidelines.
