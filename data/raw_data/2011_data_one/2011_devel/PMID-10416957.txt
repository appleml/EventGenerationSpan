The p53 paradox in the pathogenesis of tumor progression.
# T1 Protein S1 4 7 4 7 p53

Recent evidence suggests that the p53 molecule appears in two different forms: the mutant p53 that stimulates tumor progression, and wild type p53 that inhibits tumor progression.

# T3 Protein S2 90 93 149 152 p53
# T4 Protein S2 143 146 202 205 p53

In addition, it has been established that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) can activate the expression of wild type p53 in concert with the nuclear transcription factor, NF-kappa B. Both TNF-alpha and NF-kappa B are also involved in the stimulation of the pathway that leads to the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and, hence, antigen presentation to the T cells.

In this paper we shall advance the hypothesis that: (i) TNF-alpha indirectly controls immune surveillance; and (ii) TNF-alpha controls DNA repair and tumor suppression through the regulation of wild type p53.

Thus, it is hypothesized that elevated TNF-alpha is primarily responsible for promoting tumor progression.
