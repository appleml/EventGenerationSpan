Potent gene regulatory and antiproliferative activities of 20-methyl analogues of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3.

The biological active form of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD), regulates cellular growth and differentiation.

This provides the hormone with an interesting therapeutic potential.

However, hypercalcemia is a side effect, which is caused by VD's classical action, the regulation of calcium homeostasis.

This made the need for VD analogues with selectively increased cell regulatory properties.

Studies with 20-epi analogues pointed out the importance of the carbon-20 position and led to the development of 20-methyl derivatives of VD.

In this report the biological properties of the compounds ZK161422 and ZK157202, which are 20-methyl- and 20-methyl-23-eneanalogues, respectively, have been analyzed in comparison with VD.

Both compounds show about 2-fold lower affinity to the VD receptor (VDR) than VD.

@ T3 Binding S8 33 47 875 889 lower affinity
% E1 Binding:T3 Theme:T2

However, compared to VD, their antiproliferative effect is up to 30-fold higher on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and even up to 300-fold higher on human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.

Whereas the hypercalcemic effect for ZK157202 is also increased 10-fold, ZK161422 has the same calcium-mobilizing potency as VD.

Moreover, ZK161422, but not ZK157202, showed preference for gene activation from a promoter carrying a VD response element with a palindromic arrangement of two hexameric receptor binding sites spaced by 9 nucleotides (IP9) rather than for activation from a response element formed by a direct repeat spaced by 3 nucleotides (DR3).

This observation supports a model, in which promoter selectivity reflects the selectively increased antiproliferative effect of VD analogues.
