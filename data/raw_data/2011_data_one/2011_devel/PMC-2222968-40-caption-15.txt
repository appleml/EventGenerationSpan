Schematic Structure of the FOXP3 Gene and Location of the GATA3 Sites
# T1 Protein S1 27 32 27 32 FOXP3
# T2 Protein S1 58 63 58 63 GATA3

The scheme shows the location of the 11 exons spaced by a large intron (6000 bp) from the 5'untranslated region (UTR).

Human, murine, and rat sequences are aligned and transcription start site (TSS) is indicated with an arrow.
