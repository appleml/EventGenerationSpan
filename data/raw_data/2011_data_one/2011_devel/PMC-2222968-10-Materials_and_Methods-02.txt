Isolation of CD4+ T cells.
# T1 Protein S1 13 16 13 16 CD4

CD4+ T cells were isolated from blood of healthy human volunteers using the anti-CD4 magnetic beads (Dynal, Hamburg, Germany) as previously described [60].
# T2 Protein S2 0 3 27 30 CD4
# T3 Protein S2 81 84 108 111 CD4

The purity of CD4+ T cells was initially tested by FACS and was >/= 95%.
# T4 Protein S3 14 17 197 200 CD4

Monoclonality of T cell clones was confirmed by TCR-chain mapping and was identified to be Vbeta8 positive.

The clones were characterized by high IL-4 secretion.
