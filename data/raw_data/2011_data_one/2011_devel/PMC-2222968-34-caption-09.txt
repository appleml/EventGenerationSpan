Phenotype of In Vitro Differentiated T Cells

After two round of differentiation cultures, T cells were stimulated by plate-immobilized anti-CD3/CD28 and 3H-thymidine incorporation as measurement of proliferation was analyzed after 3 d of culture (A).
# T1 Protein S2 95 98 140 143 CD3
# T2 Protein S2 99 103 144 148 CD28

In parallel, T cells were analyzed for Treg relevant surface receptor expression as indicated on the x-axis (B).
