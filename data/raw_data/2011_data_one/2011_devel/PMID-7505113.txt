The lymphotoxin promoter is stimulated by HTLV-I tax activation of NF-kappa B in human T-cell lines.

The HTLV-I transcriptional activator tax was used to gain insight into the mechanism of lymphotoxin (LT; TNF-beta) gene induction.

Tax-expressing cell lines produce LT biologic activity.

An LT promoter (LT-293) CAT construct that contained an NF-kappa B site was active in the LT-producing C81-66-45 cell line, which contains defective HTLV-I but expresses tax.

The observation that a mutated LT-kappa B construct (M1-CAT) was inactive in C81-66-45, confirmed the importance of NF-kappa B in LT gene expression.

Jurkat T cells stably expressing tax contained elevated levels of NF-kappa B that directly bound to the LT-kappa B site.

Tax co-transfected with reporter constructs into Jurkat cells maximally activated HTLV-I-LTR-CAT and kappa B-fos-CAT and also activated LT-293 to a lesser extent.

In JM T cells, tax induced LT-293 activity by two- to four-fold, though there was no induction of M1-CAT.
# T13 Protein S9 15 18 974 977 tax
# T14 Protein S9 101 104 1060 1063 CAT

The increase in LT-293 CAT activity mirrored the increase in LT biologic activity seen under these conditions.
# T15 Protein S10 23 26 1088 1091 CAT

These studies, the first to demonstrate induction of LT promoter activity over basal levels, indicate that HTLV-I tax causes low-level activation of both endogenous LT and the LT promoter, at least in part through activation of NF-kappa B.
