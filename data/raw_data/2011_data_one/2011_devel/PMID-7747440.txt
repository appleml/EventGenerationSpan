Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is known to infect B cells and epithelial cells.

We and others have shown that EBV can also infect a subset of thymocytes.

Infection of thymocytes was accompanied by the appearance of linear EBV genome within 8 hr of infection.

Circularization of the EBV genome was not detected.

This is in contrast to the infection in B cells where the genome can circularize within 24 hr of infection.

The appearance of the BamHI ZLF-1 gene product, ZEBRA, by RT-PCR, was observed within 8 hr of infection.

The appearance of a novel fusion transcript (RAZ), which comprised regions of the BZLF-1 locus and the adjacent BRLF-1 locus, was detected by RT-PCR.

In addition, we demonstrated that the EBNA-1 gene in infected thymocytes was transcribed from the Fp promoter, rather than from the Cp/Wp promoter which is used in latently infected B cells.

Transcripts encoding gp350/220, the major coat protein of EBV, were identified, but we did not find any evidence of transcription from the LMP-2A or EBER-1 loci in infected thymocytes.

These observations suggest that de novo EBV infection of thymocytes differs from infection of B cells.

The main difference is that with thymocytes, no evidence could be found that the virus ever circularizes.

Rather, EBV remains in a linear configuration from which replicative genes are transcribed.
