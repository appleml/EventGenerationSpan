Convergence of costimulatory signals and differences from transformed T cells.

To study transcriptional regulation in normal human T cells, we have optimized conditions for transient transfection.

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter-reporter gene behavior closely parallels the endogenous gene in response to T cell receptor and costimulatory signals.

As assessed with mutagenized promoters, the most important IL-2 cis-regulatory elements in normal T cells are the proximal AP-1 site and the NF- kappaB site.
# T4 Protein S5 59 63 501 505 IL-2

Both primary activation, with phytohemagglutinin or antibodies to CD3, and costimulation, provided by pairs of CD2 antibodies or B7-positive (B cells) or B7-negative (endothelial) accessory cells, are mediated through the same cis-elements.
# T5 Protein S6 30 48 630 648 phytohemagglutinin

Interestingly, the nuclear factor of activated T cell sites are much less important in normal T cells than in Jurkat T cells.

We conclude that IL-2 transcriptional regulation differs in tumor cell lines compared with normal T cells and that different costimulatory signals converge on the same cis-elements in the IL-2 promoter.
