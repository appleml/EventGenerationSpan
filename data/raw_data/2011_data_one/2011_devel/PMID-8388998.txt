Cell-specific bifunctional role of Jun oncogene family members on glucocorticoid receptor-dependent transcription.

Interaction between protein kinase C (PKC)- and glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated signaling is suggested by the ability of the PKC activating phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to inhibit GR-dependent transcription of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) long terminal repeat (LTR).

# T2 Protein S2 73 75 189 191 GR
# T3 Protein S2 214 216 330 332 GR

Here we report that this interference is cell specific, as TPA augmented dexamethasone-induced transcriptional activation of the MMTV LTR in several T cell lines but was inhibitory in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts.

TPA-GR synergism was determined to have occurred at the GR-responsive element (GRE) level by functional analysis of deletion mutants or synthetic GRE oligonucleotides driving chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase expression.

# T5 Protein S4 56 58 686 688 GR
# T6 Protein S4 175 209 805 839 chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase

Synergism required an intact GR DNA-binding domain, whereas amino- or carboxyl-terminal domains were dispensable.
# T7 Protein S5 29 31 881 883 GR

The effect was abrogated by the PKC inhibitor staurosporine, suggesting a role for PKC.

Increased c-jun, jun-B, and jun-D expression above basal levels and increased transcriptional activity of AP-1/TPA responsive elements fused to chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase vectors were observed in T cells treated with TPA alone or in combination with dexamethasone.

The ability of Jun proteins to cooperate with GR in T cells has been investigated after transfection of c-jun, jun-B, or jun-D expression vectors, which augmented GR-dependent transcription from either MMTV LTR or GRE.

Conversely, c-jun and jun-B transfection blunted GR-dependent transcription in HeLa cells.

The presence of c-fos had a negative influence on GR function and correlated with the cell-specific synergistic or antagonistic activity of Jun with respect to GR; high basal expression of c-fos as well as AP-1 DNA binding and transcriptional activity were observed in HeLa cells, but not in T cells.

Furthermore overexpression of exogenous c-fos has an inhibitory effect on GR-dependent transcription from GRE in T cells.

We propose that Jun plays a bifunctional role on GR-dependent transcriptional activation of GRE, selecting either synergistic or antagonistic activity depending on the cell-specific microenvironment.

In this regard, intracellular levels of c-fos appear to be influential.
