Functional interaction between the two zinc finger domains of the v-erb A oncoprotein.
# T1 Protein S1 66 73 66 73 v-erb A

The v-erb A oncogene of avian erythroblastosis virus is a mutated and virally transduced copy of a host cell gene encoding a thyroid hormone receptor.
# T2 Protein S2 4 11 92 99 v-erb A

The protein expressed by the v-erb A oncogene binds to DNA and acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of both the thyroid hormone receptor and the closely related retinoic acid receptor.

The v-erb A protein has sustained two amino acid alterations within its DNA-binding domain relative to that of c-erb A, one of which, at serine 61, is known to be important for v-erb A function in the neoplastic cell.

We report here that the second alteration, at threonine 78, also plays an important, although more indirect, role: alteration of the sequence at threonine 78 such that it resembles that of c-erb A can act as an intragenic suppressor and can partially restore function to a v-erb A protein rendered defective due to a mutation at position 61.

Threonine 78 lies within the D-box of the v-erb A protein, a region thought to mediate receptor-receptor dimerizations, and is not in physical proximity to the serine at position 61.
# T10 Protein S6 42 49 1027 1034 v-erb A

It therefore appears that an indirect interaction occurs between these two sites and that this interaction is crucial for v-erb A function.
